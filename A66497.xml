            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Inſpection of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, and from them an inveſtigation of directions concerning the Medicinal practice, began to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Ancients, even from the firſt beginning of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: for from hence for the making of judgments concerning the Sick, and for the chuſing the moſt fit times for Curing, the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath chiefly taken both his praenotions, and his precepts, ſo that that famous and to this day approved ſtatute of old Medicine, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to compoſe Medicine according to digeſtions, cannot be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without rightly conſulting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal. Alſo this ſeems conſonant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, that for as much as we cannot ſearch into the moſt intimate parts of the ſick Body, as it were a Veſſel ſhut up, judgment is ſought from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed liquor, waſhing all its parts, and taking from many ſome little parcels. For neither more certainly do the acidulous or Spaw-waters, ſhew the nature of the hidden Mine, through which they are ſtrained, than <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the divers manners of dyſcraſies of our Bodies, and their habitudes. Wherefore the Contemplation of this Excrement, (as vile as it is) hath grown to a Science, and hath exerciſed the ingenuities of the moſt excellent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, both Ancient and Modern. Concerning this thing there are many Books extant, writ with great diligence; in which are rehearſed the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, varieties of Colours, and diverſities of Conſiſtence, and their Contents exactly deſcribed, and diſtinct precepts are delivered for every excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: Which indeed are eſteemed by ſome of ſo great certitude, that from the inſpection of the water, a ſignification is ſought of any Diſeaſe, or of the part affected; yea of every accident concerning the ſick. But in this the common people are egregiouſly deceived, and ſtill pertinaciouſly will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whilſt they imagine the knowledg of every Diſeaſe, and the prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it cannot be found out, but by inſpecting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine; and eſteem a Phyſician of little worth unleſs he undertakes to divine from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal as from a Magical Glaſs. But indeed, as to what belongs to the precepts, and rules, whereon the reaſon of Judgment by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine doth depend, there are many col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by diligent obſervation, that are extant, and from thence eſtabliſh'd with good reaſon and judgment: yet for as much as the ſignification of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines is by ſome too largely extended to particular Caſes, very many uncertain things interwoven, and ſome obnoxious to deceit, and others plainly falſe; therefore who ſhall confidently pronounce concerning the buſineſs of the Sick, by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only of the Water, deſerves rather the name of a jugling Quack, than of a Phyſician.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:107014:18"/>
                  <p>But this Doctrine concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, abounds ſo ordinarily with errors, that the obſervations which belong to its practice, are either wrongfully made, or not well reduced into method. We may lawfully ſuſpect that the obſervations are not rightly made, becauſe, perhaps from one or two particular caſes, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a general Rule is eſtabliſhed. For Example ſake, becauſe ſome Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical people render a thin and watery <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, therefore it is affirmed, ſuch ſort of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines neceſſarily denote a Dropſie, when alſo in ſome other diſeaſes, ſuch like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines are made; and ſometimes in the Dropſie, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine are thick, and full of redneſs. Alſo as it is moſt commonly received, that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines on which a cream doth ſwim (as on water that hath Tartar boyled in it) doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a Conſumption, which is moſt uncertain, becauſe this ſign is more proper and familiar to Hypochondriacks, than to Conſumptive people: And how many dye of Conſumptions, without this? Beſides, what is generally aſſerted, to wit, that in all diſeaſes whatſoever, Nature doth make known the Diſeaſe by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, is altogether falſe; becauſe ſometimes ſick people make their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine like healthful people; and ſometimes thoſe who are very well in health, by reaſon of ſome accident (perhaps from the meats eaten) have ſuſpected <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, varying from the natural ſtate or condition. As to what belongs to the method, or doctrine delivered by most, concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, they ſeem to be altogether Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirical, and nothing rational: for the naked differences of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines are rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are wont to be diſtinguiſhed according to their colour, conſistency, and contents: thence are oppoſed to the ſeveral ſpecies of theſe pathologick ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, collected only from more rare obſervations; when in the mean time, the cauſes of the appearances, nor of the preternatural alterations in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, are not aſſigned, as they ought to be; nor is the ſignification of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Cauſes of diſeaſes, but only to the Diſeaſe or Symptom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt often deceitful, and uncertain; becauſe the ſame morbifick Cauſe, and ſignification of the ſame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, may in like manner mediately reſpect at once divers Diſeaſes, and Symptoms. As for Example, a thin and watry <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine moſt often immediately denotes Indigeſtion, or a defect of Concoction in the Viſcera: nevertheleſs, by reaſon of that condition of Crudity, the Green-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Virgins, ſometimes the Dropſie, or the white watery phlegmacy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Head-aches, and many other diſeaſes ariſe. But the task which you have required of me, Worthy Sir, to wit, That the notions which in times paſt we have diſcourſed together, and conceived concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, as it were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected notes, and what have ſince fallen under my own knowledg, by my proper ſtudy and obſervation, concerning this thing, ſhould be fram'd into a little Treatiſe, and that I ſhould write a plain, and new method of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinoſcopie. I confeſs the work greater than can well be performed by our own proper ſtrength: however, I have reſolved as much as I am able, to obey you therein. But that a doctrine or method concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines may be inſtituted, beyond the vulgar and plainly Empirical manner of Philoſophiſing, there ſhall be theſe two heads of our Diſcourſe. To wit, Firſt that the Anatomy of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine may be delivered, of what elements and parts it conſiſts; and alſo its geneſis in our Body; to wit, by what Concoction this kind of Liquor is made, and then by what ſecretion of ſome Particles from others. Secondly, That the inſpection of urines in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal may be truly unfolded, and what may be the Rules, and the Certitude of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>romancie, or divination of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHEN the Liquor of the Urine, being either freſh rendred from the body, or putrified by a long digeſtion, is expoſed to a ſpagirick Analyſis, it is wont to be reſolved into theſe parts or principles: In the Diſtilling, firſt, aſcends whatever of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſpirit is in it, diluted with water; but yet in ſo very ſmall quantity, that it is not eaſily to be perceived by the taſte it ſelf. To this follows a watry liquor, large enough in proportion, with which are mixed ſome more looſe particles of Salt, and Sulphur eſpecially. Thirdly, There is ſtilled forth a very penetrative water; which is commonly called the ſpirit of Urine, but in truth almoſt without any vinous ſpirit, and is chiefly phlegm highly ſharpned with Salt, and therefore it aſcends laſt, as in the diſtillation of Vinegar: but foraſmuch as the ſalt of Urine is volatile, but that of Vinegar only in the Flux; therefore the liquor ſtilled forth, which is greatly impregnated with its particles, is very acid: That which is imbued with the ſaline Particles of the other, is exceeding ſharp and pricking. It is a ſign that this kind of Spirit of Urine (as it is commonly known) ows its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs chiefly to the Salt; becauſe, though it be moſt ſubtil it will not take fire, but being put to it extinguiſhes it. After the humidity is wholly exhal'd, another porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Salt remains with the earth, in the bottom of the cucurbit; to which if a more hot fire be made, that Salt will be ſublimed into the Alembick, and the earthy feces only remain. This kind of Anatomy of Urine plainly ſhows, that the Elements of which its liquor is compoſed, are a great deal of Water and Salt, and a little of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Earth, and a very little of Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The ſaltneſs in Urines is perceived by the taſte and touch; it comes neareſt to a Nitrous ſalt in ſavour: It is drawn indeed from ſaline particles of things eaten, which being more plentifully exalted by the concoction in the Bowels, and the circulation in the Veſſels, for the moſt part go into a volatile Salt. That is truly Salt and Spirit, by reaſon of the long accompanying of either together, are gathered into a moſt ſtrict bond; and therefore it happens, that the Salt it ſelf otherways fixed, is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up on high, and rendred able for motion, as it were by the wings of the other. Urines contain in them more or leſs of Salt, according to the diſpoſition of our body, and have it either more volatile or fixed; which are therefore of a divers colour and conſiſtency.</p>
                     <p>That there is Sulphur contained in Urines, their quickly putrifying, and ſtink, ſufficiently teſtifie: it ariſes from the fat and ſulphureous particles of Meats, in the concoction being moſt minutely broken, and boyl'd with the ſerum and ſalt; ſo as alſo there is leſs plenty of Spirit in it, than is in Blood, Soot, or the Horns of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: wherefore in the diſtillation of Urine, there aſcends nothing almoſt of an oylie form or fat. But indeed, whilſt the blood is circulated in the Veſſels, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ſulphureous little bodies, which fall away from it, do for the moſt part evaporate out of dores; in the mean time, the ſaline recrements, and the watery, chiefly conſtitute the Piſs: nevertheleſs, Urines do always participate a little of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, but its quantity and proportion, is diverſly altered according to the various degrees of Concoction and Crudity; and thence alſo the colour and conſiſtence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many mutations in Urines.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107014:19"/>
                     <p>That there is but a very little of vinous ſpirit in Urines, the defect of it in the liquor firſt diſtilled forth, alſo the ſoon putrifying of the Stale do teſtifie: but that there is ſome, the inteſtine motion of the particles in the Urine, doth argue, to wit, the departure of the thin from the thick, and the ſpontaneous ſeparation of ſome parts from others, and a collection of them into a ſettlement: beſides, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line particles (for that they are made volatile) are married to ſpirituals, and ſo they are of a more ready motion, and energy; yet according to the divers plenty of ſpirits in Urines, and their power, there ariſe divers manners of hypoſtaſes and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; alſo the Urines themſelves, ſooner or ſlower putrifie.</p>
                     <p>The watry part of the Urine far exceeds the reſt in quantity, and is greater than they by almoſt a ſixth part: it is not ſo ſimply drawn forth by diſtillation, but that ſome particles of Salt and Sulphur (for as much as they are volatile) aſcend with it, and impart to the water an ingrateful ſtink: the potulent matter, copiouſly taken with aliments, affords an original to this; which of what kind ſoever it be, before it is changed into Urine, lays aſide its proper qualities, and acquires others; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the aſſumed liquor, there is nothing ſincere almoſt left in the Piſs, beſides meer humidity.</p>
                     <p>That there is earth, and muddy feces to be had in Urines, its diſtillation, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration ſufficiently declares: for when the reſt of the parts are exhaled, the earth as it were a <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> will remain in a moderate quantity in the bottom: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in the nouriſhing juice, there is required ſomething ſolid beſides the active principles of ſalt, ſulphur, and ſpirit, whence the bulk and magnitude of the body grows; the recrements of this, <hi>viz.</hi> the earthy ſeculencies, are plentifully diſſolved in the ſerum, and contribute to it a thick conſiſtence and contents: but theſe ſhew themſelves after a divers manner, according to the ſtate of Concoction and Crudity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the principles which conſtitute the body of the Urine, alſo into which it is eaſily reſolved, by a Chymical Analyſis: Out of the divers changes, and various contemperation of theſe, the other accidents of Urine ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Quantity, Colour, Conſiſtency, and Contents, which are as to the ſenſe the moſt notable concerning it, and the chief objects of the rendred Urine: For when there is nothing almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held beſides in the Piſs, they conſtitute theſe firſt Phaenomena, in which rightly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, conſiſts the whole Hypotheſis of this Science: Wherefore we ſhall ſpeak in the next place concerning theſe, and firſt of the Urine of healthful people, what its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity may be, how coloured, with what conſiſtence and contents indued; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be unfolded, out of what mixture of Elements, and by what Concoction in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and Veſſels, each of theſe depend. Secondly, ſhall be ſhown how many ways the Urines of Sick people vary from the ſquare or Rule of this of the Sound: and I ſhall endeavour to aſſign, for the ſeveral differences of them, proper Cauſes of their alterations; and theſe ſhall conclude our firſt propoſition in this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Anatomy of Urine.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Quantity and Colour of the Urines of Sound People.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Quantity of the Urine in found people ought to be a little leſs than the humor, or liquid ſubſtance daily taken; for moiſt and drinkable things dayly taken, are the matter it ſelf of which Urines are firſt made: But theſe (hunger and thirſt urging) are more plentifully required, both that they may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently waſh the maſs of the Chyme, by which means it may rightly ferment in the Viſcera; and that they may ſerve for a Vehicle, both to the Chyme, whereby it may be conveyed to the bloody Maſs, and to the Blood it ſelf, that it might be circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Veſſels without thickening; and to the Nervous Juice, whereby it might actuate and water the Organs of ſenſe and motion: when the ſerous Latex by this means hath beſtowed whatever it hath almoſt of Spirit and Sulphur, for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heat, and Motion, it gives way to a new nutritious humour; and it ſelf as unprofitable, being ſecluded from the Blood, by the help of the Reins is ſent away.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107014:19"/>The nouriſhing liquor, which will at laſt be changed into Urine, of its own nature is divers, <hi>viz.</hi> now watry, now impregnated with Spirit, now with Salt and Sulphur, and according to the various forces of this or that Element in it Urines are wont to be ſomewhat altered: However all liquors taken in at the mouth, do not paſs thorow our body whole and untouched; but that they undergo mutations in various parts, and loſe a little portion of their quantity, before they are made into Urine: For the Latex or Humour to be converted into Urine, is firſt of all received into the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, (for I aſſent not to <hi>Reuſner,</hi> who affirms the ſame falling for the moſt part on the Lungs, to cauſe the more quick making water after drinking) whilſt that it ſtays in the Ventricle, it is there boyled; alſo impregnated with Salt and Sulphur of its own, or from more ſolid Aliments diſſolved: then very much of it is confuſed in the blood, with the nouriſhable juice; which, when it is a long time Circulated, from thence receives a farther tincture of Salt and Sulphur, according to the various temper of the Blood, and its inkindling in the Heart: Hence ſome portion of it is derived with the Animal Spirit, to the Brain and nervous ſtock; and afterwards from thence, being made lifeleſs and weak, is laſtly reduced into the boſom of the Blood; after that it hath beſtowed on the Blood and Nervous Juice, whatever of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous or noble is conteined in the Serum, alſo no ſmall quantity is conſumed by ſweat and the other emunctories; what remains, whilſt that the Blood continually waſhes the Reins, a precipitation being made, either by a ſtraining or force of a certain ferment, it is there ſeparated from the Blood, and from thence paſſes thorow the Ureters into the Bladder, and ſo is carryed forth of doors.</p>
                     <p>From the origine and luſtration of the Serous Latex, but now deſcribed, it plainly appears, that the Urine ought to anſwer to the quantity of the liquids taken, in ſomewhat a leſſer proportion, perhaps under a third part; which plainly ſhews the diſpoſition and ſtrength of the Viſcera ſerving for Concoction, as alſo the temper and diſtribution of the Blood it ſelf, and after a ſort of the nervous juice; moreover it carries with it ſigns of the affections of the Urinary paſſages. The quantity of the Urine declines often from this Rule, ſo that ſometimes it ſuperabounds, alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is deficient: and either for a ſhort time, may conſiſt with a diſpoſition not much unhealthful; but if theſe kind of diſtempers continue long, they argue a ſickly condition. Concerning theſe we ſhall ſpeak among the appearances of the Urine in a diſeaſed condition of the Body; we ſhall now next conſider the colour of a ſound Urine.</p>
                     <p>The Urine of Sound People, which is rendred after Concoction is finiſhed in the Body, is of a Citron colour, like Lye a little boyled: which without doubt proceeds from the Salt and Sulphur of the nutritious juice, and the Blood, diſſolved in the Concoction, and boyled in the Serum. This colour doth not ariſe only from Salt (as ſome would have it) becauſe the Liquor impregnated with Salt, unleſs it be evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a certain thickneſs, will not grow yellowiſh: Alſo Salt of Tartar, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by melting, continues ſtill clear. What may be objected concerning the Lye of Aſhes, I ſay, there the whole Sulphur is not conſumed by burning, but the Citron colour ariſes from ſome ſaline Particles, and others Sulphureous burnt, and ſticking together in the Aſhes, and then infuſed or boyled in the liquor. Neither doth the Urine of ſound people acquire this ſame colour from Sulphur only, becauſe Sulphur in a watry Menſtruum, is not diſſolved unleſs by the addition of Salt, nor will it give any tincture of it ſelf; but if Salt of Tartar and common Sulphur be digeſted together in water, or if Antimony be boyled in a ſaline Menſtruum, both liquors will by that means grow yellow like Urine; after the like manner, the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles of Aliments, being incocted and moſt minutely broken in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, by a Digeſtion in the Ventricle and Inteſtines, and by a Circulation with the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, impart to it a Citron Colour.</p>
                     <p>This kind of diſſolution of Salt and Sulphur, by whoſe means the Urines are made of a Citron Colour, is firſt begun in the Bowels; and afterwards perfected in the Veſſels, and very much depends upon the Concoction performed in the Ventricle and the Inteſtines: For here, by the help of heat and of ferments, the Aliments taken are chiefly ſubdued; the bond of mixture being broken, the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles being moſt ſmally broken, and made ſmall, go into a milkie Cream, and from thence the Serum remaining after that Concoction and diſtribution of that milkie juice, becomes of a Citron colour: after the ſame manner, as when the Salt of Tartar and common Sulphur being diſſolved together, and mixed with ſome acid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107014:20"/>thing, indue a milkie colour; then the contents being ſeparated by ſetling, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining liquor grows yellow like Lye. If that the aliments, by reaſon of an evil diſpoſition of the Ventricle, are not rightly digeſted in the firſt Concoction, as in the Longing Diſeaſe or Pica, the Dropſie, and other ill diſpoſitions of the Bowels, uſually comes to paſs, the Urine alſo is rendred crude, clear, and almoſt inſipid, like Fountain water; but if by reaſon of the ferments of the Viſcera being more than duly exalted, or otherways depraved as in the Scurvy, Hypochondriac diſtemper, or Feavouriſh intemperance, the particles of things eaten are too much diſſolved in the firſt Region, by that means Urines are rendred red, and thick.</p>
                     <p>The Serum, as hath but now been ſaid, being imbued with a lixivial tincture in the firſt Concoction, and confuſed in the Blood, ſo long as it is circulated with it, it is yet further Concocted, and acquires a more deep colour; for the particles of the Blood being roaſted and ſcorched, although for the moſt part they are laid aſide into the Gall bag, yet being in a manner boyled in the Serous Latex, they heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten its colour; hence the Concoction being ended, the Urine which is firſt made, is more Pale, and that which is laſt, more Red. That which is made after long faſting, is yet more high Coloured. Where the Blood is more cold, as in Cachectical people, the colour of the Urine is made leſs; where the Blood grows raging with a feavouriſh Heat, and is roaſted, the Urine grows highly Red.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Urines of ſound people, it is worth obſervation, that which is made after plentiful Drinking, hath no tincture, but is pale like water; of which we ſhall enquire, by what means the Serous Latex ſo ſuddenly ſlides away out of the Ventricle, (contrary to what is vulgarly believed) and paſſing thorow all the Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous paſſages, then the Veins, Arteries, the boſom of the Heart it ſelf, and the turnings and windings of the Veins, and Ureters, is put forth of the Body within ſo ſhort a ſpace: moreover, how it comes that the Urine being ſo precipitately made, contrary to moſt other things, is not only changed into no Colour in its paſſage, but it alſo loſes its own proper: For as the Proverb is, <hi>Our Drink goes thick in, and comes forth thin:</hi> or <hi>We Drink thick Beer, and Piſs clear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning this we ſay, that beſides the long wandring of the nouriſhing juice, to wit, whereby, after ſome ſtay in the Ventricle, it ſlides into the Inteſtines, and from thence thorow the milkie Veſſels into new paſſages, and thence is carried into the Veins, (which carrying about cannot be quickly performed) it is moſt likely, that there is another nearer paſſage of the ſame Nutritious Juce, whereby indeed it may be conveyed immediately and without delay to the Maſs of Blood, and perhaps to the nervous Liquor; and therefore, after faſting there immediately follows a moſt quick refection of ſtrength and ſpirits, after Eating, and eſpecially after Drinking; which indeed cannot be thought to be made by the Spirits and Vapours; alſo from ſuch drinking, the Urine is preſently rendred, and indeed ſooner than it can be thought, that the Maſs of the Chyle can be ſent out of the boſom of the Ventricle; wherefore, it is not improbable, that when the Alimentous Liquor is entred the Ventricle, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the more thin portion of it, which conſiſts chiefly of Spirit and Water, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by its Spongeous Membranes; and from thence being inſtilled into the little mouths of the Veins, it is preſently confounded with the Blood, flowing back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart. For of this opinion (though not very ſtubbornly) I always was, <hi>That the Chyme was in ſome meaſure immediately derived from the Ventricle, and Inteſtines, by the branches of the Vena Porta, into the Maſs of Blood;</hi> and as the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie paſſages carry it about by a long compaſs, whereby it may be inſtilled into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Trunk of the <hi>Vena cava;</hi> ſo that it may be carried in a more near way, <hi>viz.</hi> into the aſcending Trunk of the ſame, by theſe Veſſels; foraſmuch as the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made poorer in its Circulation, returning from either part, before it had entred the Heart, it ought to be refreſhed with a new juice, whereby it might more lively ferment in the boſom of the Heart; but foraſmuch as the much greater part of the Blood is carryed upwards, ſurely it may ſeem agreeable to truth, that at leaſt ſome portion of the nouriſhing Juice may be added to this, as it were a ſuſtenance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before burnt forth, and almoſt lifeleſs, for its new inkindling in the Heart. The Arguments that ſeem to perſwade to this, not of light moment, I could here heap together, but I ſhould ſo divert far from our propoſition: wherefore, that we ſo ſuddenly make a wateriſh Urine after Drinking, I eſteem to be done after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was but now ſaid; therefore the Liquor that is carryed ſo haſtily from the Aliments to the Maſs of Blood, paſſing thorow the ſo narrow windings (as are the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107014:20"/>Membranes of the Viſcera) being drawn as it were by diſtillation, the more thick matter being rejected, conſiſts almoſt only of Water and Spirit; with which indeed it refreſhes the vital Spirits, and dilutes the Blood; about which task, when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous part is conſumed, the watry Latex, becauſe of its plenty, being heavy and troubleſome, is continually ſent away by the Reins; and when it comes from the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, not yet imbued with Salt and Sulphur, nor is long circulated with the Blood, that it might by that means acquire a lixivial tincture, it is rendred thin, and clear.</p>

                     <p>SO much for the Quantity and colour of Urines, which proceed from a ſound Body; but as to what belongs to the Contents, we muſt know, that there ought to be nothing beſides the Hypoſtaſis in a ſound Urine; but what this is, and by what means it ſinks down, remains to be unfolded in the next place.</p>
                     <p>So long as the Maſs of Blood, being fuſed with the ſerous and nouriſhable humour, is continually Circulated in the Veſſels, from it a certain nutritious juice is made, by a perpetual digeſtion, which being put continually to the ſolid parts, goes into nouriſhment: This firſt of all is digeſted into a glutinous humour, like the white of an Egg, afterwards into thin Filaments or Rags, which being interwoven in the Pores and little ſpaces of the ſolid parts, ſtill afford to them an increaſe of new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but whilſt the Serum being mixed with the Blood, waſhes all the Regions of the Body, it ſucks up into it ſelf a certain ſuperfluous portion of this laſt Aliment, to be lay'd on the ſolid parts, and carries it forth of dores with it ſelf; and this it is that conſtitutes the Hypoſtaſis or ſettlement in Urines; wherefore ſo long as this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it indicates how far Concoction and Nutrition in ſome meaſure is performed, and is accounted a laudable ſign; its abſence ſhews Crudity and Cachectical people, or a Dyſcraſie in Feavours; it conſiſting of ſmall Threads or Filaments, is diſperſed at firſt thorow the whole body of the Urine, and then is collected into a little Cloud, by this means. Theſe Filaments or Threads, are long, and ſmooth, alſo indued with ſome ſharpneſſes like Brier-pricks, that from thence being ſhaken about, they eaſily lay hold of one another, and are faſtned together; even as if into an Urinal full of water, you ſhould caſt many Hairs, and then by ſhaking about the Veſſel, the hairs at firſt ſwimming diſperſedly, in a little time would lay hold on one another, and be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into a little bundle; after the ſame manner (as it ſeems) the little threads which conſtitute the Hypoſtaſis or ſettlement being variouſly here and there agitated by the colour and ſpirits implanted in the Urine, intangle and thruſt upon one another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they gather into one little Cloud by the mutual knitting of all together; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Filaments are compacted, and more ſolid than the other Contents of the Urine, they ſink towards the bottom with their weight.</p>
                     <p>It is very likely, that theſe kind of Filaments, make the Hypoſtaſis in the Urines of Sound people, for that the Blood being well conſtituted, and diſpoſed to nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is very much ſtuffed with Fibres, or white Filaments: becauſe, when a Vein is opened, if the Blood let out be received into warm water, it will be conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to any one; for the red thick ſubſtance being diluted with the liquor, theſe ſmooth and white threads ſwim in the water; wherefore it ſeems, that ſome of theſe thin or ſlender rags, being ſnatch'd away with the ſerous juce, are the matter of this cloud ſubſiding in the Urine; wherefore in Cachectical people, by reaſon of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, the Blood being very wateriſh, and unfit for nouriſhment, is deſtitute of theſe well labour'd Fibrils; alſo in Dyſcraſies, when the nutritious humour, the Blood being too much ſcorched, is not rightly concocted into theſe kind of Filaments, the Hypoſtaſis in Urines is either wholly wanting, or is very confuſed and diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid to be a good and laudable Hypoſtaſis, which is of a whitiſh colour, of a round and equal figure, and ſinks towards the bottom, to which are required, Firſt, that that laſt Aliment be rightly labour'd, whereby the Filaments may become white, ſmooth, and ſolid, like to ſlender Fibres. Secondly, that the Urine be ſufficiently ſtrong in ſpirits, which (as is beheld in the growing hot of Muſt, or new Wine)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107014:21"/>may agitate, and compel here and there all parts. Thirdly, that the liquor be not too thick, nor that its Pores be firſt poſſeſſed by ſtrange bodies, whereby the motion of the contents may be hindred, but that a ſufficient ſpace may be leſt, for the free agitating and toſſing about theſe kind of Particles.</p>
                     <p>If the ſubſtance be red, it is a ſign that that laſt Aliment is ſcorched and burnt, with too much heat; wherefore ſuch a ſediment, for the moſt part is in the beginning of a Feavour, ſo long as the Coction in the Viſcera and Veſſels, is not wholly perverted; if the Hypoſtaſis be broken and unequal, it is a ſign that the nutriment deſtinated for the ſolid parts, is not rightly and equally concocted, and that its Particles are not homogene, and alike in every part: wherefore the Filaments do not cohere together, but theſe with thoſe, and they with others, are entangled apart; hence ſome more thick deſcend towards the bottom, and others more light ſwim upon the top. When the Hypoſtaſis does not wholly ſink down, but hangs all of it, either in the middle or upper Region, that happens, becauſe that thoſe Filaments are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly laboured, nor ſolid and compact, but more rare and ſpungy, or becauſe the liquor is thicker, and more impregnate with Salt and Sulphur, and therefore like Lie it ſuſtains ſome weights, which otherwiſe would ſink to the bottom. Sometimes the Hypoſtaſis is wholly wanting, in ſound people, after long faſting, immoderate labours, or copious ſweating, the matter being wholly conſumed into nutriment, or evaporated by ſweat; in Feavours, by reaſon of the very depraved condition of the Blood; alſo in the Pica, Cachexie, and other Diſtempers of that kind, by reaſon of the great Crudity.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the conſiſtency of the Urine in ſound people, there is not much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conſideration to be met with: It is wont to be of that ſort, as midling Beer is, being purified by a long Fermentation; or Lye a little boyled, <hi>viz.</hi> the watry liquor of the Urine, ought to include in its Pores and paſſages, a great many Particles of Salt, and Sulphur, moſt ſmally broken, and diſſolved; and beſides a little of earth, divided very exceeding ſmall, and diſperſed thorow the whole body of the Piſs; if the conſiſtence be thinner than it ought, as it is in clear, or limpid Urines, and watry, it is a ſign of indigeſtion and crudity; that the Aliments are not fully overcome, and Concocted; but if the Urine be thicker, and cloſer than it ought, it is a ſign, that the body of the liquor, is filled with preternatural Contents. But of theſe elſewhere, when we ſhall ſpeak of the Urines of the Sick.</p>
                     <p>Thus far of Urine, foraſmuch as it is an Excrement, and ſign of Concoction in a ſound body (truly performed in the Viſcera and in the Veſſels) the quantity or bulk of which is to be determined by the potulent matter; the colour Citron, from the diſſolved Salt and Sulphur, and boyled in the Serum; the Hypoſtaſis or Contents depend upon the Filaments, elaboured in the Blood, for the nouriſhment of the ſolid parts; the conſiſtency on the Salt and Sulphur, together with the Particles of Earth, filling the Pores and paſſages of the ſerous liquor. It next remains, that we treat of the Urines of ſick people: in which alſo, the Quantity, Colour, Contents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and ſome accidents beſides, offer themſelves to conſideration.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IN a Morbous proviſion of Bodies, or Sickly eſtate, the quantity of the Urine does not exactly quadrate with the proportion of the liquid things taken; for ſometimes it wants of its due meaſure, and ſometimes exceeds it. When the Urine is much leſs than the drinkable things taken, the reaſon is, becauſe the watry Latex either ſtays ſomewhere in the Body, or is diverted by ſome other way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, than by Urine: if it remains within; Firſt, it is either heaped up about the Viſcera, and their Cavities, and ſo is ſtay'd now in the Ventricle, more than it ought to do, and induces by the diſtention of it, troubles, with ſpitting; but more often, it is laid up in the hollowneſs of the Abdomen, and ſometimes of the Thorax and head, and there is wont to cauſe Hydropic Diſeaſes. Or, Secondly, the Serum ſtagnates in the Veſſels, and ſo increaſes the bulk of the Blood, and Nervous Liquor,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107014:21"/>and notably perverts its motion; whence Catarrhs, Rheumatick diſtempers, and often Palſies and Convulſions are cauſed. Or thirdly, this watry humour is fixed in the habit of the body, and ſo creates a ſwelling up of the whole body, or of ſome parts. Or fourthly and laſtly, it is obſtructed in the urinary paſſages, by the Stone, or thick matter, as it were a dam oppoſing it; and cauſes in thoſe parts pains and Convulſions, and a fulneſs of the Serum in the whole body. When the ſerous water is other ways beſtowed, the Patients are for the moſt part prone to frequent and troubleſom Sweats, or almoſt to a continual Looſneſs.</p>
                     <p>The diſtempers therefore which the ſmall quantity of the Urine is wont to indicate, are ſometimes the ſwelling up of ſome of the Viſcera, and a heaping up of water in them, ſometimes Catarrhal diſtempers, ſometimes evil diſpoſitions of the nervous ſtock: ſometimes an Anaſarca and watry Tumors; and ſometimes the ſtony diſpoſition of the Reins and Bladder. And ſometimes alſo the diminution of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is the effect and ſign of ſome other preternatural evacution, <hi>viz.</hi> an immoderate excretion of Sweat, Lask, or ſome other thing. To deſcribe here exactly all the ſubſiſtences of the ſerous Latex, either in the body, or the cauſes of it other ways excreted, and the manner of doing it, were to transfer hither almoſt the whole matter of Pathology; for many and divers are the occaſions and circumſtances, whereupon this Serum is heaped up in this or that part, and ſubſiſting in the body, diminiſhes the quantity of the Urine; but for the moſt part the principal and moſt frequent cauſe of this conſiſts not ſo much in the fault of the Liver, Spleen, or Reins, as of the blood it ſelf: to wit, a copious and free making of Urine, as alſo its ſtay in the body, and only made in little quantity, depend chiefly on the temper of the blood, and either on its kindling, or fermentation in the heart: for if the blood be ſtrong in rightly exalted principles, (<hi>viz.</hi> Spirit, Sulphur, and Salt) it grows very hot in the Veſſels, and ſo the frame of the liquor being looſe enough, it is duly kindled by the ferment of the heart; and almoſt ſpiritualizes the whole, paſſes through all parts with heat and a rapid motion, without ſtopping, and whatſoever is ſuperfluous and volatile, evaporates out of doors: and whilſt the blood is rarified, and boiling with heat, paſſes through the Reins, what is ſerous is eaſily ſeparated, either by the ſtrainer of the Reins only, or (which is moſt likely) by a coagulation, and is as it were precipitated from the remaining maſs of the blood. The ſame thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt happens after this manner to the blood, as we may obſerve in Milk, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt it is warmed, and grows hot, it moſt eaſily goes into parts, and its Serum is moſt eaſily ſeparated by the leaſt drop of Runnet, or Coagulum put into it: but if you pour much more ſtrong and ſour ferment into it, when it is cold, a precipitation will hardly follow; ſo if the blood becomes through an evil conſtitution, or ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, more cool and watry, that being leſs endued with active Elements, it grows but dully hot, and is but little kindled in the heart; it is circulated very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and difficultly in the Veſſels; paſſing through the Pores and paſſages of the Viſcera, it cleaves a little to them, and leaves ſomething behind it; whence are begotten every where Obſtructions and Tumors; alſo the blood by this means becoming viſcous and cool, and ſo unfit for precipitation or percolation, lays aſide leſs readily its excrements in the Reins; but leaves them every where in the body, becauſe it hardly, and not without the reſidence of a certain humor, is circulated. Wherefore in this ſtate, thoſe things that move the blood very much, as exerciſe and a more quick motion; or alſo ſuch as may fuſe it, as it were with a Coagulum or Runnet, as are ſharp things, and preparations of Salts, will more freely provoke Urine.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happens, that the Urines of the ſick are made in a large quantity, and very profuſe, that in a day and a nights ſpace, they make perhaps twice or thrice as much water, as the Liquids they have taken; the cauſes of which diſtemper are alſo various, and the ſignifications very divers; if after the ſuppreſſion of Urine, or its quantity formerly leſſened, if in Hydropick diſtempers, Rheumatiſms, or paſſions of the nervous ſtock, or in the Criſes of Feavers, a flowing down of the Urine follows, either of its own accord, or by the uſe of Diureticks, it denotes a Cure of the diſeaſe, or preternatural diſpoſition, or at leaſt a declining of it. But if (as I have often obſerved) in a lean and weak conſtitution (without any of the previous diſtempers but now recited) the Urine exceeds much the Liquids taken, and from thence a great debility of the whole follows; this indeed ſignifies an evil diſpoſition, with a tendency to a waſting or Conſumption. I have known ſome women of a tender and moſt fine make, who ſometimes being ill, for many days,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107014:22"/>were wont daily to make water in a great abundance, (exceeding twice the Liquids taken) and that watry and thin, without contents or ſettlement; at which time they have complained of a languiſhing of ſtrength, difficult reſpiration, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency to motion. I ſuppoſe in this caſe, that the blood and nervous juyce grow too ſour, from the ſalt carried forth, and ſuffering a Flux, and therefore that they are ſomewhat looſned in their mixture, and fuſed ſo much into ſeroſity, as to be made fit for it. For it is to be obſerved, that all Liquids, though more thick and mucilaginous, if they be kept to a ſourneſs, preſently become for the moſt part wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and limpid: alſo the flowing down of the Urine is ſometimes ſeen to ariſe from ſuch a diſpoſition of the blood and humors: for that the Urine ſo copiouſly excreted, is like Vinegar in taſte; and theſe kind of diſtempers are uſually cureed, chiefly by Chalybeates, and not by binding and thickning things.</p>
                     <p>But as to what reſpects the Colour, the Urine of ſound people may be the ſquare or rule, to which all the reſt of the ſick may be referred; for as the colour of ſound peoples is Citron, the Urine of the ſick is paler than Citron, and ſo either watry, or white, or higher coloured than it; whoſe chief kinds are, flame-colour, yellow, red, green, and black. I ſhall run through every one of theſe briefly, and endeavour to weigh them together, by what cauſes all the alterations may be made, and what diſtempers, or proviſions of diſeaſes they are wont to make known.</p>
                     <p>The Urine is watry or limpid, when by reaſon of the indigeſtion of the Ventricle, the ſaline and ſulphureous particles of things eaten, are not rightly ſubjugated, nor being ſmally broken, are made ſo volatile, that being diſſolved in the Serum, they may impart to it a tincture, which it may carry with it, through the ſeveral turnings and windings of its paſſage: For the Latex or juyce to be changed into Urine, becauſe it is forced through very ſecret paſſages, and narrow, as it were by a certain diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; therefore it is wholly deprived of the colour and conſiſtency, which it had from the taken Liquids, and imbibes almoſt nothing, but the volatile part, from the Chyme, whoſe Vehicle it is. Wherefore, if by reaſon of the great crudity, the Salt, Sulphur, and other contents are not firſt made volatile in the Viſcera, nor afterwards diſſolved in the Veſſels, that they may make their paſſage together with the ſerous juyce; it being at laſt ſtripped almoſt of all, is ſent out like clear water. That ſuch Urines do want the active principles, it is a ſign, becauſe they are kept a long time from putrefaction: This ſort of Urine denotes in Virgins, for the moſt part, the Green-ſickneſs, in moſt the Cachexy or Dropſie; in all it is a note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion and crudity. Sometimes in thoſe obnoxious to the Stone, it foretels the approach of the fit, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the Serum is coagulated by the ſtony juyce in the Reins, its diſſolutions and contents are congealed into a tartareous matter, only a watry juyce or Latex ſtaying behind. Thoſe who for ſome time make a thin and watry Urine, whatever ſickneſs they are obnoxious to, have often adjoyned to it a difficulty of breathing, and ſhortneſs thereof after motion, and a diſtention about the region of the Ventricle, and as it were a ſwelling up after eating. The reaſon of the former wholly depends on the defect of ſpirits in the blood, becauſe its liquor is not fully imbued with active principles (of Spirit, Sulphur, and Salt) rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; therefore it is not ſufficiently kindled by the ferment of the heart, whereby the whole may preſently leap forth, and break as it were into a flame: but that hardly fermenting, and being apt to ſtagnate in the heart, and for the moſt part to reſide there, burdens it grievouſly: wherefore if the blood ſo diſpoſed, is urged more than it is wont, by a more quick motion, into the boſom of the Heart, becauſe not being rarified of its own accord, it may preſently go wholly forth, therefore there is need of great endeavour of the Lungs, and a more quick or frequent agitation, whereby it may be carried forth. Therefore watry Urines ſignifie this kind of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the blood; becauſe, for as much as they receive no tincture almoſt from the Salt and Sulphur, it is a ſign that the Particles are little diſſolved in the maſs of blood, or are rendred volatile. As to what appertains to the inflation of the Ventricle (of which alſo limpid or clear Urines are the effect and ſign) I ſay, becauſe of a defect of due Fermentation, the Chyle goes not into a volatile Cream, but (like bread not fermented) into a ſad and heavy maſs; which indeed is ſlowly, and not without a reſidence of viſcous Phlegm, carried out of the ſtomach: its reliques being impacted in the folds and Membranes of the Ventricle, obſtruct all the Pores and paſſages, that nothing may vapour forth, nor that the thin and ſpirituous part may be conveyed (as it ought to be) by the ſecret paſſages, to the blood: hence flatulencies are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107014:22"/>which continually diſtend the Ventricle, and blow it up beyond its due bulk: alſo when thoſe Feculencies are left a long time in the ſtomach, they abound in a fixed Salt, and degenerate now into an acid, now into a vitriolick matter, or of ſome other nature; from whence Heart-aches, deſire of abſurd things, oftentimes Heat with cruel thirſt, and ſometimes Vomiting ariſe: ſome of which though they argue a very ſharp heat to lye hid within, yet by reaſon of the want of concoction, ſuch diſtempers often render the Urine crude and watry. We have treated thus largely of a limpid or clear Urine, becauſe from hence the reaſons of the reſt (which as to colour and conſiſtency are pale and thin in healthful perſons) may be drawn. For from the Salt and Sulphur, more or leſs diſſolved and boiled in the Serum, the appearances of a pale and ſtraw-coloured Urine, and of other colours, under a Citron colour, are excited; and by the like means, which was ſaid of the watry, they may be unfolded.</p>
                     <p>There remains another certain kind of Urine, more pale than the Citron colour, not thin, but thick and cloudy, and of a whitiſh colour; it appears by common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that children do often make ſuch water, when they are troubled with the Worms: The reaſon of which ſeems, becauſe the matter whereof the worms are made, is a certain viſcous Phlegm, heaped up in the Viſcera, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion of the Chyle, and a defect of making or generating Spirits, which matter at firſt tranſmits no tincture to the Urine, becauſe of its fixity, the ſame afterwards putrifying is exalted, and is in ſome manner volatilized; and then partly by heat and ſpirit, is formed into worms, and partly being confuſed with the paſſing Chyle, and carried into the veſſels, when 'tis made unfit for nouriſhment, it is ſeparated with the Serum from the blood, and being mixed with the Urine, gives it that white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Sometimes alſo in Feavers, eſpecially of children, the Urine is whitiſh: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, becauſe the ſupplement of the nutritious juyce being poured from the Chyle to the maſs of blood, is not rightly aſſimilated, but degenerates into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humor: A portion of which being incocted in the Serum, imparts to it the thick conſiſtence and milky colour: otherwiſe than in the Feavers of thoſe of riper years, where when the heat is ſtronger, the ſame degenerate juyce impreſſes on the Serum a red colour. Alſo the Urine is whitiſh in the flowing of the Whites, the Gonorrhoea, Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder, and of the urinary paſſages, by reaſon of the confuſion or mingling of the filthy matter, or the corrupted ſeed: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that the colour of the urine be white, it is produced from its contents, which at laſt putting down its ſettlement to the bottom, the liquor for the moſt part becomes of a paliſh and yellowiſh colour; even as it may be perceived by the making of the Milk of Sulphur, where the milky ſubſtance ſinking down to the bottom, the over ſwimming liquor is of a Citron colour.</p>
                     <p>Urines whoſe colour is deeper than Citron, owe their appearance, not only to the Salt and Sulphur diſſolved more than uſual, but in ſome ſort to the more thick contents in the liquor. The more plentiful diſſolution of the Salt and the Sulphur, is chiefly performed in the veſſels, in the maſs it ſelf of the blood, and from thence the Tincture is impreſſed on the ſerous Juyce: But this happens to be done for the moſt part, after a double manner, <hi>viz.</hi> either by reaſon of the feaveriſh fervour, for as much as the blood boiling in the veſſels, and being more kindled in the Heart, is very much looſned in its mixture, and ſo copiouſly fixes on the Serum the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Salt and Sulphur, waſted as it were by the boiling: Or without a Feaver, when theſe kind of ſulphureous and ſaline little bodies, wont to be ſent forth at other ſinks, are reſtrained; and ſo being by degrees heaped up in the blood, are poured into the Serum. Of this alſo there are two chief cauſes or means; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the excrements of the blood, which chiefly participate of aduſt Sulphur, and that ought to be ſent away by Choler-carrying veſſels, are retained, and ſo they impreſs, being ſuffuſed on the ſerous humor, a tincture of yellowneſs: or elſe the Effluvia's, which are chiefly of a ſaline nature, and ought to be evaporated by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tranſpiration, are reſtrained, and from thoſe the urine is filled with a lixivial tincture. The urines of the former kind are proper to people that have the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; but thoſe of this latter are familiar to the Scurvy: for in the Scurvy the ſaline particles of the blood depart from volatilization, and get a Flux: wherefore, by reaſon of their fixity, they will not evaporate, and ſo being more fully heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the blood, they more and more pervert its Craſis, and very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the ſerous humor with a ſaltneſs. The contents which heighten the colour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107014:23"/>of the urine, are of a twofold kind, to wit, either aduſt recrements, remaining after the deflagration of the blood, or particles of the nutritious juyce, degenerated into an extraneous matter: Concerning which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter in their proper place. It now remains that we deſcribe particularly the ſeveral Colours of Urine more intenſe or deep than Citron colour.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt is a flame-coloured urine, which ſhines with a brightneſs like the Spirit of Nitre: and this is very often ſeen in an intermitting Tertian Feaver; this colour ariſes from a portion of the thinner yellow Bile, mixed with the Serum, whilſt it is in motion: for that in this Feaver there is a ſharp and hot intemperature of the blood, which burns and ſcorches all the humors, and ſo plentifully begets Choler. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this, for the moſt part, is ſeparated from the maſs of blood by the bilary veſſels and paſſages; yet when it abounds in the veſſels, a part of it, or (which is the ſame thing) ſome burnt and aduſt particles of the blood and humors being boiled in the ſerous water, impart to it an high or deep yellowneſs. This urine is thin and ſhining, for that there is in this diſeaſe almoſt a continual breathing forth, that thruſts out the recrements of the nutritious Juyce, and all the thicker parts of the Serum towards the circumference of the body.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Saffron-coloured urine, and which dyes Linen with the ſame colour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is a ſign of the Jaundice: it is tinged after this manner by the yellow Bile or Choler, or by the Salt and Sulphur burnt and plentifully mixt with the Serum: for the yellow Bile is neceſſarily begot from the yoked heat and motion of the blood; but for this the Gall bag is deſigned by Nature, for the ſeparating it from the maſs of the blood, its paſſages being rooted in the Liver: But if ſuch a ſeparation be any ways hindred, that humor flowing back in the blood, and copiouſly heaped together, infects the skin with its yellowneſs, the blood, and eſpecially the ſerous Latex. The Saffron-coloured urine differs from the flame-coloured, becauſe in this only a certain portion of the more thin Bile is poured into the urine, but in that the more thick part, and much more plenty: beſides, in the yellow Bile the Sulphur, with the Salt, being joyned and long circulated, is fully diſſolved by it, that it becomes like paint, imparting to every ſubject a Saffron-coloured tincture; as when common Sulphur and Oyl of Tartar are mixed together. But what things cauſe a redneſs in urines, without the reſtagnation of this Bile, happen after the ſame manner, as in the Lye of Aſhes: where the particles of the Sulphur, without any previous diſpoſition from the ſaline, are forthwith put down with them in the Liquor.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It remains that we ſpeak next of red Urines, which are of a divers habit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they always depend on the ſame cauſes, nor plainly denote the ſame kind of diſtempers; we ſhall briefly run through the chief differences and proper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them. Firſt, the liquor of the urine is either red of it ſelf, and remains after the ſame manner, nor is the colour altered by the ſetling or ſinking down of any of the parts: or ſecondly, the redneſs of the urine chiefly owes its colour to the Contents, which being ſetled to the bottom, the liquor grows yellow, or is leſs red. The diſtempers that theſe kind of urines are wont to ſhew, are chiefly Feavers, and a confirmed Scurvy, and Conſumption. We ſhall conſider the reaſons of each.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Urine that is made red ſo remains, it is firſt either of a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, and ſomewhat clear, and then it owes its colour to the Salt and Sulphur, being burnt more than uſual, and ſo boiled more copiouſly in the Serum: or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch an urine is red, and alſo troubled and cloudy: but this, beſides the contents of Salt and Sulphur, has boiled in it ſome earthy particles alſo, which indeed being impacted in the Pores and paſſages of the ſerous Latex, do not deſcend: becauſe the liquor of the urine is deſtitute of convenient ſpirits, which may ſegregate all hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous things, and drive them to the bottom, as is wont to happen uſually in dead drink, or Beer growing ſour by reaſon of Thunder; where the liquor is infected with a troubled Feces, and by reaſon of the defect of ſpirits, will not grow clear; wherefore this kind of urine is a very bed ſign in Feavers, becauſe it ſhews ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the blood of aduſt and to be ſeparated matter, ſuch as the vital ſpirits are not able to maſter by taming and ſubjugating it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes the Urine is made red, by reaſon of its contents; which ſetling in the bottom, the liquor becomes of another colour: but theſe contents, as before we hinted, are twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> now thin, which are the remaining matter, or aduſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements after the burning forth of the blood; now more thick, to wit, the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate particles of the nutritious Juyce; both theſe being torrified, and ſeparated from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107014:23"/>the burning blood, are partly thruſt forth by Sweat, and partly mixed with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Latex, thicken its conſiſtence, and heighten its colour, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as theſe kind of contents are included in the Pores and paſſages of the liquor, they are ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the colour of the urine appears more deep, and the conſiſtency thicker: but theſe being precipitated to the bottom, both the redneſs and thickneſs of the liquor are leſſened. The reaſon of this ſhall be given anon, where we ſhall ſpeak of the Cauſes of the Colours, and alſo of the Clearneſs and Cloudineſs of Urines: we ſhall now inquire, what is the reaſon of the difference, that red urines are wont to be made both in Feavers, and alſo in the Scurvy, Conſumption, and perhaps in ſeveral other diſtempers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In Feavers, the liquor of the Urine is filled with redneſs, becauſe of the more plentiful diſſolution of the Salt and Sulphur, and their particles copiouſly boiled in the Serum; for whilſt the blood and humors grow hot, from the feaveriſh cauſe, by reaſon of the heat being more fully inkindled, the ſaline and ſulphureous little bodies, being burnt and torrified, are more diſſolved; and being boiled in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Juyce, impart to it a deeper tincture: Even as if the Lye of Aſhes be boiled over the fire, it grows more red, than if it were only made by infuſion. Alſo in Feavers, the contents of the urine moſt often increaſe its colour, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and deflagration of the blood, both the degenerate particles of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juyce, and alſo other matter (as it were the Aſhes remaining of the burning of the blood) are burnt together, as it were into a reddiſh Calx; which being included in the Pores of the urine, renders its colour deep, and afterwards ſinking down, makes a ſediment like red Oker.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a long Scurvy, the liquor of the Urine grows ſometimes ſo highly red, that it cannot be greater in a burning Feaver: if ſuch urine be evaporated, or expoſed to diſtillation, it will ſhew great plenty of Salt, with a muddy Feces or dregs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems to be manifeſt, that this deep redneſs doth chiefly ariſe from the Salt, (as we have already hinted) by this Experiment; becauſe in Scorbutick people the ſaline particles, which ought to be made volatile, and ſo conſtantly exhaled by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, become fixed, and being hindred from a flux, are heaped together more plentifully in the diſtempered body. The Salt remaining within, is variouſly coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sulphur and Earth, and then is continually diſſolved: and from this diverſe coagulation and diſſolution, the to be admired Symptoms of this Diſeaſe are cauſed. Alſo from the ſaline little bodies plentifully diſſolved with Tartarous feculencies, and diluted with the Serum, urines are filled with an high redneſs; to which moſt often happen in this inveterate diſeaſe vices of the Liver and Gall; for when theſe Inwards, being either obſtructed or other ways depraved, cannot perform their tasks, for the ſeparating the aduſt particles of the blood, they being more fully heaped up in the blood, are diſſolved in the ſerous Juyce, and infect it yet with a more lixivial tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. And if the aduſt particles of the Sulphur do excel the reſt of the fixed and ſcorbutick Salt, the yellow Jaundice happens together with the Scurvy, and the urine fixes to Linen a Saffrony tincture. But if they be leſs than they, and that the ſaline particles excel, the Scorbutick diſtemper only is produced, in which the urine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly red, yet does not dye the Linen. I am perſwaded that it is thus; becauſe, when I have opened the dead carcaſſes of many dead of the Scurvy, in whom there was a red urine, I obſerved that the Liver or Gall was in fault: In ſome the Liver was wholly without blood, and dry like a Cows Udder; in others the bag of the Gall was empty, and nothing in it; in others it was beſet with little ſtones; in others it was filled with filth, not bitter; in all theſe Inwards were ſo diſtempered, that the ſecretion of the Bile was hindred.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By reaſon of this kind of diſſolution of the Salt, Urines ſometimes grow red in Arthritick diſeaſes: for beſides the Gout (in which ſuch urine is often made) I have obſerved in ſome a painful diſtemper, and as it were like a Feaver, cauſed, with a very high-coloured urine; they had wandring pains, now in this place, now in that, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly tormenting, that the ſick were ſcarce able to ſtand, or to ſtir their limbs: they were obnoxious to wakings and frequent ſweats; they were alſo troubled much with thirſt, and heat of their mouth: and they had a urine highly red, with a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful red ſediment. In the mean time it did not appear, either by the Pulſe, languiſhing of the Spirits, or Head aches, that the blood grew exceſſively hot, or that they had a Feaver. Wherefore I ſuppoſe that this kind of diſtemper doth chiefly conſiſt in the nervous ſtock, and depends on the exorbitances of the ſaline Principle, rather than the ſulphureous.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Alſo in the confirmed Phthiſis or Conſumption, eſpecially if an Hectick Feaver be joyned with it, there is a red Urine; the reaſon of which is, if at any time an Ulcer is excited in the Lungs, the putrid filth from thence being mingled with the blood ſliding by, cauſes in it almoſt a continual efferveſcency, whereby the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous and ſaline particles being more plentifully diſſolved and boiled in the Serum, affect its liquor with redneſs: beſides, by reaſon of the blood being defiled after this manner, the nouriſhing Juyce degenerates almoſt wholly into putrefaction, by whoſe recrements the urine being filled, grows more red, and is very much ſtuffed with contents: The ſign or note of this is, that the ſick for the moſt part grow hot after eating, and that they are troubled with an heat through their whole body, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a nightly ſweat; beſides, their urines yield a thick and copious ſediment, to wit, when the nouriſhing Juyce, being mixed with the blood, is not aſſimilated, it ſtirs up in it a fervour, and being degenerate into an extraneous matter, exhales partly by ſweat through the Pores of the skin, and partly being tranſmitted to the urine, very much heightens its colour and conſiſtency.</p>
                     <p>Thus far of a red Urine, whoſe ſeveral ſpecies, but now related, have more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intention and remiſſion, accordingly as the cauſes, altering the colour and conſiſtence in them, are either weaker or ſtronger.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As to what belongs to a green and black Urine, I confeſs I have never ſeen thoſe kind of deep colours (exactly like thoſe of Leeks and Ink) in any urine: but I imagine I may have ſeen the appearance of a greeniſh colour from a more deep yellow, and of a blackiſh urine from the ſame with a cloudy and ſomewhat a dark mixture, and from thence called by Authors a green and black Urine. But thoſe urines, coloured after that manner, are eſteemed either ſigns of the Jaundice, or of being diſtempered with ſome virulency of the blood, if they continue ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for ſome time: or ſuch urines, as occaſion offers, are variouſly changed, and are now of this or that, and preſently of another colour. So I have known Hypochondriacks wont to make ſuch urines, as it were critically for ſome time, and then afterwards to render them like ſound men. As to the firſt, when the Jaundice is very great upon them, that the aduſt portions of Sulphur and Salt remain a long time in the maſs of blood, they acquire by a long incoction a fulneſs of the yellow colour, at firſt green, and afterwards black, and impart the ſame to the Serum: For if the yellow Bile, being taken out of the bag of the Gall, and put into a Cucurbit, be expoſed to the gentle heat of a Bath, the ſame in a ſhort time will grow green, and afterwards appear like the blackeſt Ink: wherefore in the black Jaundice, which is only the yellow carried forth into a worſe ſtate, by its long ſtay or continuance, there is nothing more uſual than to make black urines. Beſides, theſe kind of urines ſometimes appear in a malignant Feaver, and in the Plague, alſo often from drinking of poyſon, and in this caſe it is for the moſt part a ſign of death, becauſe it argues the blood greatly corrupted, and the ſpirits profligated, and the bond of the mixture looſned, as it were the deadly or mortified diſtemper: even as where ſome part of our body, being diſtempered with an Ulcer, is afterward taken with a Gangrene or mortification, forthwith the flowing corrupt matter, which was at firſt white, wateriſh, or yellow, becomes black. Wherefore in the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſtempers, when the urine grows black, the Serum and the blood being wholly vitiated, the skin alſo is dyed outwardly with ſuch a colour. As to what belongs to urines periodically tinctured with a greeniſh colour, and eſpecially with black (which happen often to Hypochondriacks) it is moſt likely, that ſuch ariſe from the melancholick Feculencies laid up in the Spleen, and from thence, by reaſon of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, too much flowing forth ſometimes, and confuſed with the blood: for ſuch a matter, being often poured into the Ventricle in ſome men, ſtirs up black Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, alſo in others, the ſame being ſupp'd up from the blood paſſing through, may impart ſuffuſions of the ſame colours to the ſerous Juyce.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Colours of Urines, of which the more pale ariſe from too much Crudity, almoſt all the high-coloured, either from the Salt and Sulphur plentifully miſſolved, and ſometimes from the aduſt recrements throughly boiled in the Serum, or from the more thick contents of the urine; whether they be the Calx and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the aliment, degenerated in the concoction, or the waſting or melting of the pining body, or ſome part of it evilly diſtempered: what hath been ſaid may be better underſtood, if the means, whereby theſe kind of diſſolved things or contents are able variouſly to change the colour of the urine, be unfolded.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:107014:25"/>
                     <p>The cauſes of the diverſity of appearances of colours, and their variouſly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo of the cloudineſs and clearneſs in Urines, (as in all other Liquors) depend only on the various incidency and emerſion of the beams of light, as is hinted in another place, in the Tract of Fermentation: For if the ſubſtance of the liquor be rare and thin, with open Pores and paſſages, that the beams of light may eaſily paſs through, it is ſhining and clear like fountain-water: but if the Pores of the liquor be filled with contents, or little bodies ſwimming in it, ſo that the luminous beams are broken in their paſſage, but ſo that at length they may ſhew themſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe various manners of refraction and emiſſion, there will appear a Citron, a Saffron, or red colour in a yet clear liquor. If that, in the little ſpaces of the Pores yet more obſtructed, the light cannot paſs through, there is a darkneſs induced: but then if the immerſed beams be a little or nothing reflected, the liquor will appear of a brown or dark colour; but if they are beaten back, according to the diverſe manner of reflection, a white, aſhy, or ſome other kind of appearance, is induced. From this being ſuppoſed, according as the liquor of the urine, ſometimes almoſt wholly deprived of Salt and Sulphur, and other things diſſolved, eaſily admits of light, ſometimes either very much ſtuffed, or elſe moderately with theſe kind of contents, either diſtorts the beams falling on them in their paſſage, or wholly imbibes them, or laſtly beats them back; it were eaſie to explicate all the Phaenomena or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of colours and their conſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>It often happens, that the colour of the ſame Urine is variouſly changed: for what is made red, being expoſed to the air, becomes white, or of a dark colour, and then after a long time of a Citron colour: the reaſon of which is this, if I am not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this kind of urine, when it is made, is red, becauſe the Pores of the Liquor are very full of contents; yet ſo long as they are dilated with heat, they tranſmit the rays of light, (although variouſly diſtorted) that they may at length ſhew themſelves or appear; but this urine is no ſooner expoſed to the cold, but that the Pores being ſtraitned, the ſite and poſition of the parts is changed in the contents, and by that means the paſſage of the beams of light is hindred: wherefore the liquor preſently becomes cloudy, and according as thoſe beams are reflected after this or that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a white, or brown, or ſome other kind of colour is induced: but at length the contents falling down towards the bottom with their weight, the Pores being freed, tranſmit again the rays of light, and do not diſtort them; wherefore a clear or a Citron colour appears.</p>
                     <p>From theſe things which have been ſpoken concerning the Colours of Urines, may appear what is the cauſe of the various conſiſtence of urines. For as the particles of Salt and Sulphur, of the aduſt matter, or nutritious Juyce, depraved in the aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, are more or leſs boiled in the Serum, urines alſo get their more thin or thick conſiſtency. It remains next that we ſpeak more clearly of the Contents in preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Urines, whereof we have often made mention.</p>

                     <p>WE ſuppoſe the Contents in the Urines of ſick people to be twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> either univerſal, which proceed from the maſs of Blood, and of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Liquor, and reſpect the habit of the whole Body; or particular, which are the layings aſide or excrements of one bowel, or part ill affected, of which we ſhall ſpeak anon. Thoſe of the former kind, which come away from the whole, are either natural, <hi>viz.</hi> Filaments or ſmall threads conſtituting the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis or ſettlement, as in ſound Urines; or preternatural, which chiefly are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the nutritious humour degenerate from aſſimilation, and conſtitute the more thick bodies of the ſediment in Urines; and laſtly to theſe, (if there be a feaveriſh intemperance) the aduſt matter of the blood after deflagration, and diluted in the ſerous Juyce, is added, and increaſes the bulk of the Contents.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Contents, both natural and preternatural, of Urines, repreſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after a various manner, as the blood more or leſs unduly grows hot, alſo as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107014:26"/>the aliments in the bowels and veſſels are variouſly concocted, and either the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities or corruptions of the Chyme, from thence made, are waſhed away with the Serum: for if the nouriſhable humour tranſmitted to the blood, is not all perverted, but a great portion of it, laid upon the ſolid parts, is changed into nouriſhment, ſome parts of this alſo rightly made, being mixed with the Serum, impreſs yet ſome marks of an Hypoſtaſis in urines: Alſo from the aduſt or degenerate matter, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural ſediment is framed, yet little and thin, neither doth it wholly blot out the appearances of this natural. Wherefore in the beginning and declination of a Feaver, ſometimes alſo in a Conſumption, or a Cachexy an Hypoſtaſis, though not ſo perfect, is perceived. If that the greater portion of the ſame Chyme, growing hot with the blood, by reaſon of the immoderate heat, is perverted into an hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene matter, which afterward is ſent away with the Serum, as hurtful and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, preſently an obſcure and imperfect Hypoſtaſis appears; and beſides it, very many contents are ſeen in the urines, which heighten their colour and conſiſtency. Such an urine, which contains an Hypoſtaſis, though imperfect, together with other things of the ſame kind diſſolved in it, if it be kept in a warm place, the Hypoſtaſis will be perceived alone; but the reſt of the contents, comprehended in the pores of the urine, dilated by the heat, are made wholly inconſpicuous or not to be ſeen: yet afterwards the little ſpaces of the Pores being ſtraitned by cold, the ſame contents are precipitated, and by that means they render the ſite and poſition changed, and the urine troubled and cloudy, and blot out the appearance of the Hypoſtaſis. Theſe kind of urines in the better ſtate of Feavers, in a Catarrh, Cough, difficulty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, fulneſs of humours, and in the more light Dyſcraſies are wont to be made.</p>
                     <p>But if in the more grievous ſtate of ſickneſs the Concoction be wholly vitiated, and the whole nutritious Juyce changed into a putrefaction, theſe kind of contents alſo may be perceived in the urine without an Hypoſtaſis, and ſignifies variouſly in diſeaſes, after their various ways of being precipitated, and ſinking down, and conſtituting a diverſe kind of ſediment; to wit, as the ſeparation of the parts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſoon or late, or not at all; and as the matter falling down ſhall be little or much, or alſo of a white, red, or dark colour. I will briefly run through what is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and worthy obſervation concerning this thing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This kind of Urine being full of contents, is not ſometimes at all precipitated, (unleſs the ſubſtance of the liquor be diſſolved by putrefaction a long time after) but remains a long while troubled and ſomewhat cloudy, with little bodies ſwimming through the whole. The reaſon of this is, either becauſe theſe contents are too much incocted in the Serum, ſo that the ſpirits implanted therein, cannot ſeparate the pure from the impure, the thick from the thin; as may be perceived in brewing Beer, if that the Mault be too much boiled, the liquor ſhall never grow clear: or elſe the urine remains troubled, becauſe it is wholly deſtitute of ſpirits, which may compel the parts of the liquor into the motion of Fermentation; as it uſually comes to paſs in Beer growing ſour by reaſon of Thunder, or of immoderate heat, and being infected with a troubled Feces or Lee, will ſcarce ever be rightly made clear again. This kind of urine is perceived for the moſt part in very dangerous Feavers, and ſometimes in a deſperate Cachexy, and always portends evil.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes it happens, that the Urine is ſo full of contents, that it begins to be troubled whilſt it is yet warm. I have often obſerved it, after this manner, in a ſlow Feaver, whoſe heat was gentle and more remiſs, to wit, in which the particles of the nutritious craſſament or ſubſtance are depraved, but being a little ſubdued by heat, or boiled in the Serum, they eaſily fall out of its pores: as when common Sulphur is boiled in Lye, if that before it be perfectly diſſolved, it be taken from the fire, the liquor at firſt clear and red, by reaſon of the quick precipitation of the diſſolved matter, becomes preſently troubled, dark, and of a ſomewhat whitiſh colour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But what moſt uſually comes to paſs, that this ſort of Urine, big with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as long as it is hot, and ſome time after, ſeems clear and perſpicuous when it grows cold, is wont to be troubled, and as if ſome Runnet were infuſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated according to all its parts; yet the ſame, if held near the fire, or in warm water for a little ſpace, ſhall grow clear again. The reaſon of this is already fully unſolded, where we ſpake of the Cauſes of Cloudineſs and of Clearneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. After that the Urine being expoſed to the cold, is precipitated in this manner,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107014:26"/>it may be obſerved by what means its contents deſcend to the bottom; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſettle in a ſhort time: and if the liquor grows clear in the ſpace of two or three hours, it is a ſign that the liquor of the urine is not too thick, nor very much filled with Salt and Sulphur: wherefore in the beginning or declination of Feavers, when the heat is ſlack, ſuch an urine is moſt often made: ſometimes ſuch a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows not but in the ſpace of many days; the reaſon of which is, becauſe the conſiſtence of the liquor is thicker than it ſhould be, therefore the contents or diſſolved things are not ſo eaſily let go from its embrace, that they may fall down to the bottom by their weight. Theſe kind of urines are wont to be made in the ſtate or height of Feavers, and moſt often precede an evil Criſis.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Of no leſs a diverſe kind are the ſediments which fall to the bottom. That I may paſs over in this place the filthy matter, and blood, ſand, gravel, and the like, depoſited from ſome parts, I ſhall mention thoſe which are the products of the whole body, and they for the moſt part are either white or brown, or red like Oker: If you ſtrain urine, when it hath ſtood long, through brown paper, you may collect theſe contents. I have often ſeen a whiteneſs like Chalk, and ſometimes red like Bole Armene, without doubt there is the ſame matter of all, to wit, the recrements of the deflagrated blood, and of the nutritious juyce depraved in the aſſimilating: which, as they are burnt by heat in our body, and diverſly perverted, appear alſo in the urine under a various colour and form; even as Antimony mixed with Nitre, as it is more or leſs calcined exhibits a Calx, now red, now Saffron colour, now yellow, now brown: The like reaſon is (as it ſeems) of the ſediments of urines, which are as it were the Calx of the ſulphureous and earthy matter burnt forth by the fire of the Feaver in the Viſcera and Veſſels.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Beſides theſe kinds of Contents, which happen in the Urines of ſick people, I have often obſerved, that after the urine had ſtood a long while, ſomething was affixed to the ſides of the glaſs like ſand, and indeed in divers figures; for now theſe little bodies like ſand grow together with a ſharp and unequal ſuperficies, now with ridges like the Cryſtals of Nitre, and ſome ſhine and are pellucid like Ice. I have ſeen theſe kind of Cryſtals fixed to the Urinal, ſometimes in the urines of thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Dyſentery, alſo in thoſe troubled with pertinacious wakings. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in urines, when they have ſtood long, a certain Cream will ſwim on the top, as when Tartar is boiled in water: this kind of whitiſh cruſt growing together in the ſuperficies of the urine, is commonly thought to be fat and fattiſh things, and taken for the melting of the ſolid parts: wherefore ſuch as are wont to make ſuch an urine, are preſently pronounced to be conſumptive, and in a deſperate condition: But indeed that is only a ſaline concretion, which if put into the fire, will not melt, but grows hard into a cruſty ſubſtance. Yea both this and the other concreſcences of urines are as it were the Tartar brought forth in them by a certain Coagulation: But ſuch a concretion depends altogether on the particles of the fluid or acetous Salt, combined with others of the fixed or Alcaliſate Salt: For in every ſubject where there is a commixtion of the Salts of either kind, Cryſtallizations and Coagulations of a diverſe manner are cauſed, either ſpontaneouſly by Nature, or may be procured by artificial ſeparation: wherefore this kind of urine, on which this Cream ſwims, or that Cryſtals gather in the ſides of the Veſſels, indicates the blood to be departed from its ſweet and Balſamick nature (ſuch as depends on the volatile Salt) into an acid and corroſive, by reaſon of the flux and fixity of the ſaline Principle. Such an urine, if it be evaporated, leaves in the bottom of the Veſſel great plenty of Salt: the diſtempers wherein it is uſually ſound (as I have often obſerved) are ſpitting of blood, Atrophy, or general waſting, and the Hypochondriack diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>In the Urines of ſick people it is worth obſervation, whether they dye the Urinal or not? For ſometimes in Feavers the urine is no ſooner put into the Glaſs, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it darkens its ſides with a whitiſh cloud, and again at another time this does not happen: I ſuppoſe that the Glaſs is dyed, when the liquor of the urine is fuller of diſſolved Sulphur than its pores can contain within themſelves; as may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Lye, wherein common Sulphur or Antimony is boiled: Alſo every urine, if it ſtand in the Glaſs till it putrifie, will infect its ſides with a cruſt or cloud, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whitiſh, ſometimes reddiſh, ſometimes of another colour: for the frame of the liquor being looſned by putrefaction, the particles of the Sulphur being looſned from the bond of mixture ſtick to the Glaſs: But in the urines of ſick people ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this preſently follows, becauſe the Sulphur is more copiouſly diſſolved than can be included in its pores.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:107014:27"/>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the particular Contents of Urines, they indeed are manifold, and may come from many parts and places: yet they moſt often depend on diſeaſes implanted about the Reins, Bladder, and Urinary paſſages: ſometimes it happens by reaſon of an Impoſthume in the Liver, Spleen, Lungs, of other Inward; or by reaſon of preternatural humours heaped up in thoſe places, and flowing out with their fulneſs, an extraneous matter is tranſmitted into the maſs of blood, and thence into the ſerous Juyce: but this happens more rarely, becauſe an Impoſthume being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken within, for the moſt part pours out its matter into the cavities of the Viſcera, from which there is no paſſage open into the urinary paſſages: beſides the maſs of blood flowing with impurities, does not preſently endeavour to ſend them forth by urine, but oftner by ſweat, ſpitting, breaking out of Wheals, Tumors, or by other ways of excretion. Wherefore it appears by common obſervation, that the other contents of urines (than which we have above cited) are chiefly ſent from the Reins and their dependences; the chief of which are ſand, ſtones, blood, matter, bits of fleſh, skins, branny or mealy ſediments, which for the moſt part ſignifie either the ſtony or an ulcerous diſtemper, or both together, planted beyond the emulgent Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>It is an uſual thing for ſome to void with their water, gravel or ſmall ſand of a red colour in great quantity; ſome of theſe are obnoxious to the ſtone in the Reins, and are frequently tormented with Nephritick fits: I have alſo known others without pain, or other grievous Symptom, for a long time to make a ſandy water. All urines whatſoever, if they ſtand for ſome time in a leaded or earthy glazed veſſel, affix this kind of red ſand to the ſides and bottom of the Pot, to wit, the volatile Salt of the urine is coagulated with the fixed Salt of the Metal: ſo when Sal Armoniac being mixed with the filings of Steel, Sea-Salt, or Vitriol is ſublimated, the elevated flours grow notably red: wherefore it ſeems that theſe kind of little ſands are begot in the Reins, for that the Salt of the urine is coagulated with the Tartarous feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies laid up about the windings of the Reins, from whence the ſandy matter is made, which is preſently waſhed away by the ſerous Juyce paſſing through: Therefore the gravel that is ſo frequently made are no ſmall parts or fragments of a greater ſtone, (as is commonly thought) but extemporary products of the blood and Serum waſhing the winding paſſages of the Reins.</p>
                     <p>By what means little ſtones are produced in the Bladder or Reins, is not to be fully diſcourſed in this place: But without doubt it is done rather by Coagulation than Exſiccation or Excalefaction, by drying or heating. I have obſerved ſome ſick of the Stone in the Bladder, who after they have made water, were wont to void with great ſtriving and pain a thick and viſcous Juyce, which preſently hardned into a ſcaly matter: the ſmell of this was like Lye, and of ſuch a conſiſtence as Lye eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to a thickneſs, the liquor of which being made thick, preſently ſtiffens into a ſaline hardneſs. Leſſer ſtones ſometimes paſs through the urinary paſſages, and are carried out: the greater remain unmoved in their Cells. The places wherein they are uſually begotten are the narrow winding boſoms of the Reins, from thence the ſmaller ſlide into the Bladder, and if not excerned, they grow into great ſtones. I once ſaw many great ſtones ſhut up as it were in a Cheſt about the ſides of the Bladder between its Membranes; theſe without doubt being ſent from the Reins while ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, remained in the paſſages of the Ureters, creeping between the Coats of the Bladder, and there by degrees did increaſe in bulk. A Matron ſo diſtempered long before her death, caſt out of the urinary paſſage a Membrane thick and broad, full of ſandy matter, which (as appeared after her body was opened) was part of the interior Tunick of the Bladder worn and broken by the ſtones there included.</p>
                     <p>It is ordinary for Nephritick people, or ſuch as are troubled with the Stone, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to void blood or matter with their Urine: for from a greater ſtone, and endued with ſharpneſs, the fleſh of the Reins is eaſily worn, and the mouths of the Veſſels opened, whereby blood flowing out tinges the urine; and when a ſolution of unity is cauſed in this manner in the Reins, an Ulcer moſt commonly follows, whereby matter and filthy ſtuff are poured out with the ſerous water, and conſtitute a plentiful and ſtinking ſediment in the urine: then the ſore being more inlarged by the Ulcer, more large profuſions of blood often follow, and the fleſh it ſelf of the Reins being worn away, and by degrees eaten off, is voided with the urine. I viſited once an ancient Woman, who daily voided with her urine, for many months, pure blood in great quantity; beſides, as often as ſhe made water, ſhe uſed to void in great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107014:27"/>quantity pieces of fleſh, great gobbets, as it were the little Tubes of the Veſſels eaten away, that it was ſuſpected one of her Kidneys was all thus cut away from her body: yet afterwards by a vulnerary Decoction acidulated with Spirit of Vitriol, that bloody water was ſtaid, and this Woman lives ſtill well and in health. I knew another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, who uſed for a long time in making water to void at firſt blood with a purulent matter, and Membranes: then the bloody water ceaſing, for many years ſhe made a wateriſh urine with a copious ſediment, and white like ſnot, ſinking down to the bottom of the Urinal. Afterwards when ſhe began to want that ſediment, a feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh intemperance followed with pains wandring here and there, with a languiſhing of ſtrength, and other dangerous Symptoms: and when this ſick Woman was brought into danger of her life, a Tumor ariſing in her left ſide about her Reins, and ripening into a Boil or Sore, by reaſon of the large flowing out of the matter, freed her: but yet an hollow and ſinuous Ulcer pouring out a thin matter, remained in that place during her life: and being ſometimes healed up, would preſently break out again. Scarce two years after this Noble Lady having endured the ſuppreſſion of her urine for fourteen days, became apoplectick and dyed. Her body being opened, her left Kidney was quite gone, in the place of it a membranous ſubſtance growing to the Loyns, infolding the extremities of the Veſſels and Ureter, was grown up: ſome prints or marks of the Ureter remained, but without any opening into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the paſſage: yea a certain ichor or ſeroſity dropping out from the little mouths of the emulgent Artery, was carried outwardly into that ſinuous Ulcer. The other Kidney was very full of ſandy matter and ſmall ſtones; beſides, near the top of the Ureter a ſtone about the bigneſs of ones thumb was fixed, whoſe extremity was ſo fitted and firmly impacted to the paſſage or cavity of the Ureter, that it ſhut it up juſt like a Tap, and quite hindered the paſſage of the ſerous Juyce. The purulent matter comes into the urine, not only from the Reins, but ſometimes out of the Bladder and urinary paſſage diſtempered with an Ulcer; and ſometimes alſo a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſeed, or white flux, or menſtruous blood are poured into urines from the Veſſels and genital parts, and produce in them preternatural ſettlements.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the Urines of ſick people are often ſeen abundance of white Contents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of moſt ſmall bodies; which, when they are ſetled, fill up above half the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and make it white and duskiſh, the reſt remaining limpid, and thin in the upper region of the Urinal: this kind of ſediment is called Mealy, becauſe it is like water imbued with meal. Concerning this it is doubtful, whether it proceeds from the whole maſs of blood, or only from the urinary Viſcera. It appears by obſervation, that the ſame ſort of urine is always made in the ſtone of the Bladder, alſo ſometimes by reaſon of the Kidney being oppreſſed with ſome great ſtone. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw ſuch a ſettlement in urines without a Nephritick diſtemper; wherefore I have thought it almoſt indubitable to be always a ſign of the Stone: And it ſeems that it ſhould wholly depend on the juyce or humour heaped up about the bulk or ſubſtance of the ſtone: For where the ſtone is fixed in the Kidney or Bladder, the nutritious humour is there perverted from aſſimilation, and degenerates into a more thick mucor, which uſes to be copiouſly heaped up; like Ichor, which by reaſon of a Pea put into an Iſſue, runs out plentifully. But this mucor or filth being waſhed with Serum, makes that white ſediment.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of Judgments to be given concerning the Urines of ſick People.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>SO much for the Anatomy of Urines, wherein are unfolded their Elements and conſtitutive Principles, together with their chief Accidents, <hi>viz.</hi> Colour, Conſiſtence, and Contents, both what ought naturally to be in them <hi>per eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> or eſſentially, and alſo what are wont to happen to them preternaturally, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the body being ill affected. It will be eaſie for any one to accommodate this Hypotheſis to practice, and to give Judgment on Urines beholding them in the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; for from what hath been ſaid it appears of what parts the Diſeaſes are made known by the inſpection of the Urines, and what the Urine ſignifies in each of them.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107014:28"/>Concerning this ſubject there hath been enough ſaid by Authors; I ſhall therefore only touch upon it briefly, and lightly paſs it over.</p>
                     <p>Although the matter of Urine, <hi>viz.</hi> the Serum of the blood waſhes the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Body, and is circulated with the blood through all the ſeveral parts, yet it doth not lay open the condition and diſeaſes of them all, but only of thoſe to which it owes either the natural perfection and geneſis of it ſelf, or from which it receives every alteration: wherefore in ſome reſpect it ſhews the action and diſpoſition of the Viſcera ſerving to Concoction, and beſides denotes the temper and motion of the blood and humours in the Veſſels: but that any one ſhould pretend to know from the Urinal, and to divine a pain in the Head, an Impoſthume in the Throat, or any other Diſeaſe of any part, from whence nothing is communicated to the Serum, he ſhews rather his ignorance than the knowledge of any Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Urines brought from ſick perſons ſometimes are wholly like thoſe of ſound peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and then they give no light to the diſeaſe or diſtempered part; but it may be lawful, having inſpected them, to ſay ſomething negatively, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Patient is free from a Feaver, that as to the Ventricle and Concoction of the food, they are indifferently well: wherefore unleſs he be inclining to a Conſumption, or is ſick of an Impoſthume, or ſome other diſeaſe of the unity being broken; whatſoever it be, the diſtemper ſeems not very dangerous or hard to be cured.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time I would not have him declare any thing raſhly, nor proceed farther than he can with ſafety return: for I have often obſerved in ſome moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſtempers, <hi>viz.</hi> in a malignant Feaver, when with loſs of ſtrength, a weak and unequal Pulſe, eruption of Spots, and other dangerous Symptoms, the Patients have been deſperately ſick, that the urines as to the colour, conſiſtence, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis, have been laudable, as in ſound perſons, ſo that in ſuch a caſe the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician by only viewing the Urine, as to his Prognoſtication had grievouſly erred: wherefore there is ſcarce credit to be given to the ſingle teſtimony of the Urine, unleſs there be other ſigns agreeable; but that it is a lyar in the Plague and malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and deceives: the reaſon is, that in thoſe diſeaſes the blood is leiſurely, and as it were ſilently corrupted, ſometimes without any great fervour: and ſo, although its liquor be infected by Coagulation, or by mortification or deadneſs; yet becauſe it doth not burn out much at the ſame time, ſo as to make an heap of aduſt matter, as of Aſhes, the Serum is little or nothing altered from its uſual diſpoſition or tenour: Beſides, ſometimes when in ſuch a ſickneſs the blood grows very hot, whatever of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious is heaped up in its maſs, is preſently transferred to the Brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock: wherefore the ſerous water being free from preternatural contents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after its uſual manner; beſides this caſe, when the Urines appear of a deep colour, troubled, and without any ſediment, there is no reaſon why the Piſs-prophet ſhould make a Prognoſtication.</p>
                     <p>As often as the Urines of ſick people are unlike thoſe of ſound, either ſomething natural is wanting, or what is preternatural is added, or it happens both together.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There may be wanting Colour, Conſiſtence, Contents, and Quantity. If the Colour be more remiſs than it ſhould, and the Liquor paler, it indicates Crudity, and a defect of making Spirits, to wit, that the nouriſhing Juyce is not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted or exalted either in the Viſcera or in the Veſſels; ſo that the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles being carried out together, following the diſtribution as it were the diſtillation of the Serum, might throughly ſtick to the ſame, and impart alſo to it the tincture: wherefore ſuch Urine being viewed from theſe kind of Symptoms, you may unfitly divine, that there is a weight in the Ventricle, want of Appetite, evil Digeſtion, a tenſion in the Hypochondria, an unfitneſs for motion, ſleepineſs, difficult breathing, and a frequent palpitation of the Heart upon exerciſe, a pale colour, a ſwelling of the Feet and Belly, you may ſay they are in danger of falling (if not already fallen) into a Cachexy or Dropſie, and if it be a Maid, that ſhe is troubled with Longings and the Green-ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>If the Colour of Urines be remitted in a Feaver without a Criſis, it is a ſign that the fermentative matter or aduſt recrements of the blood are ſeparated from the boſom of the blood, and fixed ſomewhere, which for the moſt part happens in the Brain; and for that cauſe ſuch Urines uſe to foretel a Delirium or Phrenſie; in thoſe troubled with the Stone, a ſudden alteration of the urine into a pale and watry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, denotes the approach of a Fit.</p>
                     <p>A copious and pale Urine often ſhews the too great reſolution or melting of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107014:28"/>Salts, by reaſon whereof the ſeroſities are ſent away as it were in a flood from the whole body, and chiefly from the nervous parts: ſuch an Excretion ſometimes is healthful, and as it were critical, when the ſuperfluities happen only to be carried away: ſometimes it is ſymptomatick, and cauſes a great debility, to wit, becauſe the nutritious Juyce and the good humours are purged out.</p>
                     <p>If the Conſiſtence be thin, and the Liquor pale, it argues Crudity, want of Spirits, or too much Drinking, or the Nephritick diſtemper: if it be of a flame-colour, it is a ſign of an intermitting Tertian Feaver.</p>
                     <p>If the Contents be wanting, and it be pale, want of Concoction is ſignified, and a Cachectick diſtemper of the body. But if it be of a Citron colour, and the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency mean, without Hypoſtaſis, you may ſuppoſe the Patient to have uſed too much labour or exerciſe; or to be frequently diſtempered with Sweats in the night, or perhaps to have an Atrophy, or general waſting, or to be inclining to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                     <p>If the Urine be continually made in a leſſer quantity than it ſhould, unleſs there be a larger tranſpiration, it is a ſign that the blood is not ſufficiently purged from the ſerous Juyce: wherefore there is a neceſſity that it become more watry, and that at length a Cachectical diſpoſition of the body, or a Dropſie be brought in. But if it be ſuddenly ſuppreſſed, or made with pain and difficulty, it is a ſign of the Stone or Gravel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Something is added to the Urine, to wit, when the colour is heightned, and in the mean time the conſiſtency and contents ſhew themſelves in due meaſure, there may then be a ſuſpicion of a Feaveriſh or Hectical diſtemper: perhaps ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe may precede, as the uſe of Baths, Heat, Surfeit, or immoderate Exerciſe, which might have heated the blood; or Cold may have heedleſly been taken, whence may ariſe a ſhutting up of the Pores, and difficulty of Perſpiration. If the urine be of a Saffron-colour, and tinges the Linen with yellowneſs, you may ſay it is the Jaundice: but if it be of a Saffron-colour or red without a Feaver, and doth not dye Linen, it ſhews for the moſt part the Scurvy or Hypochondriack diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Though the Colour and Hypoſtaſis may be in good order, preternatural Contents are often in the Urine; therefore when it grows cold it is troubled, and makes a ſediment ſometimes white, and then there is a ſuſpicion of the blood's overflowing with filth, alſo of an impure Ventricle ſtuffed with excrementitious matter, or with Worms; ſometimes red, which often happens by reaſon of Tranſpiration being hindred, a Conſumption, and ſometimes by reaſon of a Surfeit, or the beginning of a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Preternatural and thicker Contents are ſometimes in Urines, ſhewing themſelves naturally, which denotes a diſtemper of ſome part about the urinary paſſages; whence Matter, Filth, Blood, the Whites, corrupt Seed, or the like, are mixed with the Urine: and you may eaſily know by asking how, and in what place the Patient is ill, what part is diſtempered; and the ſtraining the ſediments of thoſe urines will ſhew what the diſeaſe is, and you may be more ſure of the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                     <p>When Urines have ſtood ſome time, copious white ſediments are thence made; it is not eaſie at firſt ſight to know from whence they come, <hi>viz.</hi> whether from the whole maſs of blood, or only from a particular bowel imployed for the preparations of the Serum or the Seed. For the impurities of the blood and nervous juyce being depoſited under a mealy ſpecies in the bottom of the Urinal, are wont to cauſe a ſuſpicion in the Phyſician of the Whites in Women, and of the Running of the Reins in Men: ſuch like contents are alſo ſeen in Urines, which proceed from the urinary and ſpermatick parts. Amidſt theſe ambiguities, left you ſhould gueſs raſhly and confidently by the urine, and aſſert uncertain for certain things, and falſhood for truth, the difference of theſe kind of urines ought to be indicated after this manner. If the contents be univerſal, and their ſigns be to be applied to the maſs of blood; for the moſt part theſe preſently after the making (unleſs ſometimes by chance in a Critical ſeparation) are wholly inconſpicuous (as in a thinner ſubſtance,) then the urine being troubled by cold, they deſcend ſlowly to the bottom; and being ſetled, and the Urinal heated, they diſappear again. But if theſe white ſettlements are ſent from a particular neſt, they preſently diſturb and thicken the urine newly made, are ſoon precipitated, and vaniſh not by heat. But that it may appear to what bowel theſe kind of particular contents ſhould be aſcribed, 'tis eaſily made known to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men by other circumſtances.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107014:29"/>
                     <p n="3">3. The Urine is ſometimes wholly altered from the natural ſtate; the colour and contents which ſhould be therein are wanting, and ſtrange things are in their place; then indeed is indicated that there is an intemperance in the whole body, and that the Concoction in the Bowels and Veſſels is depraved; you may ſay the Patient is ſick of a Feaver; and thence by asking, you may learn and preſently pronounce that he is diſtempered with the Head-ach, Thirſt, Heat, queaſineſs of Stomach, want of ſleep, and by conſequence with other Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>It happens ſometimes, that the Urine declines from its natural ſtate, yet not to ſhew the diſtemper the Patient complains of, but either the cauſe of the diſeaſe, or the conſent of ſome other part with the diſtempered; as if any one ſhould complain of a cruel Head ach, or trembling of the Heart, and make a watry Urine, that doth not denote thoſe diſtempers, but only a crudity in the Ventricle, and ſome obſtructions about the Spleen and Viſcera, which may be the cauſe of thoſe diſtempers: I ſay in this caſe, the urine being inſpected, the chief indications are taken about the Method of Curing, and we muſt not uſe Cephalick or Cardiack Remedies, but either Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks, which cauſe Vomit or Purging, or Openers, and eſpecially Chalybeats: But the urine is ſometimes vitiated, and yet its ſignification is wholly a ſtranger to the diſtemper the Patient complains of, as if any one were ſubject to the ſleepy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or a Lethargy, and makes it red and full of preternatural contents, its inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſuggeſts chiefly coindications, <hi>viz.</hi> that we inſiſt not on too hot, but tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Remedies.</p>
                     <p>The chief uſe of Inſpection of Urines will be for the obſerving the ſtate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of every diſeaſe, as alſo the alterations towards health or death. For in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical diſeaſes, by daily inſpecting the urine, is made known to the Phyſician, by what degrees the ſickneſs may increaſe day by day; at what time purging or altering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies will be moſt fit, and what Medicines will be moſt profitable: hence is to be obſerved, whether Nature prevails on the diſeaſe or not; and a moſt certain Prognoſtication may be drawn from hence, either of the hope or danger of health; to wit, according as the ſigns of Concoction or Crudity appear in the Urines. In acute diſeaſes, hence the ſtate and height of the Feaver may be beſt known, at what time the Criſes may be expected, and with what ſucceſs; when it is beſt to inſiſt upon Evacuations, and when on Cordials. The Compaſs is not beheld with more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and diligence by the Mariner or Steers-man, than the appearances of Urines ought to be obſerved by the Phyſician for fit times and ways of Curing.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were what I had to had to ſay concerning the Judgments of Urine, not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the vain Traditions of Quacks, but what are conſonant to reaſon and truth. Beſides I know there are ordinarily delivered by Medicaſters and Old women almoſt an innumerable company of Rules and Directions of Urine-divination, that the Urinal is no ſooner inſpected, but they will undertake to divine, whether it be a man or a woman that is ſick, how long they have been ſick, what their diſeaſe is, and whether the diſtemper ſhall end in health or death; whether the Patient be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the paſſions of Love or Sadneſs, whether a Woman hath conceived with Child or not, or whether it ſhall be a Boy or a Girl, and an hundred other the like; in which uſing a vain conjecture, they either impoſe by their confidence on the minds of the credulous, or (which is more frequently their cuſtom) by a cunning craftineſs they other ways ſift out the matter by inquiring, and falſly aſcribe it to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the inſpection of Urine.</p>

                     <p>ALthough the buſineſs of the Examination and Inſpection of Urines ſeems com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly only a ſimple thing (<hi>viz.</hi> the Medicaſters and Quacks for the moſt part behold the Urine ſent in a Glaſs, ſhake it a little, and preſently give Judgment) yet to thoſe who honeſtly endeavour the recovery of the ſick, the matter ſeems a little more intricate, and they uſe to obſerve ſeveral circumſtances concerning Judgment by Urine; which being omitted, nothing indeed can be certainly or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107014:29"/>learnt in the Medicinal Practice from the Urinal. Moreover, in ſome diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, beſides the mere inſpection of the Glaſs, there are other ways of tryal to be had, by which, what lies hid in the Urines, and out of ſight, may be made clear: from whence ſome not unprofitably taking care of the ſeparation of Urine more accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have uſed to evaporate, diſtil, putrifie, and precipitate them. Wherefore we ſhall ſpeak briefly of the right manner of inſpecting Urine, and in ſome caſes of the Analyſis or ſeparation variouſly to be inſtituted.</p>
                     <p>When the Urine of the Patient is offered to the Phyſician, if it hath firſt ſtood for ſome time in the Glaſs, and if the liquor be clear, the Hypoſtaſis as it were gathered into a little cloud, and if the reſt of the contents ſink down to the bottom, there is nothing more wanting, but that forthwith a prognoſtick ſentence may be given. But if the Urine be newly poured into the Urinal, or be troubled by a former ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, you muſt ſtay till the confuſed parts be ſeparated, and the ſettlement have acquired its due place. If the Liquor be full of contents, and the Pores ſtraitned, it becomes troubled and dark, and the Glaſs muſt be put in a warm place, till the urine grow clear again, and then let it be placed for ſome time near the fire, that whilſt the preternatural or more thin contents are abſorpt by the Pores dilated by the heat, the more thick may fall down to the bottom, and the filaments or little rags making the Hypoſtaſis, (if there be any) may be gathered together below, or in the middle region; for ſo will appear what is the power of Nature, and what of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: Alſo in Feavers, the degree of heat and efferveſcency, the concoction or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the nutritious Juyce, alſo the congeſtion or heaping together of the aduſt matter in the blood, and its ſeparation begun, or wholly fruſtrated, may ſomewhat appear by the ſignification taken from Urines; wherefore you ought to proceed after this manner, when the urine is brought from far, to wit, whoſe Particles are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by much ſhaking, unleſs it be kept for ſome time in a warm place, they will not eaſily get again their due place of poſition. But if you often viſit any Patient that keeps his bed, it will be convenient, that the urine newly made, and put into an Urinal, be placed near a Stove, where, whilſt it grows moderately hot, the ſeveral parts may, after the beſt manner, be diſpoſed to a ſettlement without any trouble or diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the Urine thus naked, and as it were diſrobed from any covering, is offered to the ſight, the next caution will be, leſt any of its Phaenomena or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances being accidentally contracted, and not properly belonging to it, may impoſe upon the Phyſician: which indeed ſometimes happens, by reaſon of alterations cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them by food taken, and which chiefly conſiſt in the colour and ſmell of urines, being variouſly changed beſides Nature, and the expectation of the Phyſician.</p>
                     <p>For it is an errour commonly committed, when the Urine being yellow, and tinging the linen by the taking of Rhubarb, Saffron, Sanders, and the like, undoubtedly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it a ſign of the Jaundice; alſo the urine being imbued with blackneſs by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Caſſia, to attribute it to the melancholick Tumor or black Bile; alſo when the urine is deep colour'd by taking of Pulſe-broth, or a Decoction of Madder, or other drinks, we falſly ſuppoſe it to indicate a feaveriſh intemperance. It often happens from the drinking plentfully thin liquor, the urine is leſſened of its high colour beyond expectation, and heightned by the drinking of ſtrong drink or hotter things: unleſs the Phyſician take notice of theſe kinds of mutations, he will give but a falſe Judgment concerning Urines by looking on them. When therefore the colour is changed in the urines without any manifeſt cauſe, the manner of living muſt be inquired into, if that the alteration proceeds from what is eaten or drunk, that it may not be wrongfully aſcribed to the diſeaſe. A queſtion will here ariſe, why foraſmuch as moſt things taken in at the mouth, before they go into urine, wholly loſe all their colour; yet ſome others, which being eaten, ſo pertinaciouſly impreſs a tincture to the Serum, that they paſs untouched through all the ſtrait turnings and windings of the paſſages? The reaſon or cauſe of which conſiſts chiefly in this, that ſome mixtures have the conſtitutive parts of their colour or dye very ſubtil, and thoſe highly volatile; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe being taken only in a ſmall quantity, dye the whole maſs of the Chyle with their colour; and from thence the nutritious Juyce conveyed to the blood, aſcends co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, and its vehicle, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſerous Latex, is ſent away ſtill dyed or tinctured.</p>
                     <p>What the odour of Urines of ſound people may be, is obvious to every one that can ſmell, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt it is freſh made, it is not very ungrateful, by reaſon of the ſulphureous and ſaline Particles bound up in the ſubſtance of the liquor; when it hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107014:30"/>ſtood ſo long, that the Sulphur begins to exhale, ſharpned with the Salt, the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being looſned, it putrifies and ſtinks grievouſly. Beſides we may obſerve, that ſometimes there ariſes from urines freſh made, a ſweet odour like Violets, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they offend the noſe with a very ungrateful ſtink. The former doth not depend either on an healthful or unhealthful condition of the body, but is produced only from things taken: Turpentine, Nutmeg, and other Gumms and Spices taken in at the mouth, though of a diverſe nature and operation, impart a like ſuavity or ſweetneſs to the urine. The reaſon of this ſeems to be, becauſe in theſe kind of mixtures very many particles of the purer Sulphur (that is imbued with Spirits) are eminent; which, for that they are volatile, being confuſed with the Serum, are not contained in the bond of the mixture: wherefore the urine being made, theſe alone leap out, and not accompanied with others of the ſtinking urine, and ſo diffuſe a grateful odour; which, although it proceeds from divers kind of things eaten, yet remains ſtill after the ſame manner like Violets, for that in all, thoſe ſulphureous Particles are ſet free by digeſtion from the others joyned with them in the ſame concrete, nor are infected by different ones from the urine. But as to what reſpects the ſtinking urine, that ſometimes proceeds from an Ulcer about the Reins, Bladder, or urinary paſſages; ſometimes alſo it is raiſed from a too hot intemperance of the Reins, or of the whole Body: for when the Sulphur is deeply boiled in the Serum, its particles being ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Salines, (for that they are leſs cloſely ſhut up) do preſently evaporate, and grievouſly affect the ſenſe of ſmelling; but beſides, ſometimes urines contract a ſtink from things eaten. For the Balſam of Sulphur, Garlick, Aſparagus, Cider, Rheniſh Wine, and many other things taken at the mouth, do cauſe a ſtrong ſmell in the urine. If the reaſon of this be demanded, we ſay that ſuch things which impart a ſtink to the urine, alſo provoke it in a more plentiful quantity: wherefore it ſeems that theſe ſort of things being taken, fuſe the blood, and greatly haſten the precipitation of the Serum: and when by this means the ſerous Juyce is pulled away as it were abruptly from the blood, the frame of the liquor is made lax, nor are its parts exactly mixed, nor contained in an equal bond of diſpoſition: wherefore when this urine is made from the body, its frame or ſubſtance being before looſned, the particles of the more groſs Sulphur (that is combined with Salt) preſently breathe out, and ſo diffuſe a ſtinking ſmell. For urine thus altered by things taken, ſeems very like to Lye, wherein Antimony or common Sulphur is boiled, and is aſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inſtilled into ſome acid thing, becauſe in this Decoction, as alſo in ſuch urine, the frame of the liquor being unlocked, the little ſulphureous bodies leap out, and affect the ſenſory with a ſtinking ſmell.</p>
                     <p>If that any one more curious in the ſearch of Urines, ſhall ſeek further than the examination of the ſight and ſmell, he may eaſily, by a divers manual operation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them into parts, and as it were diſſect them to the life, and thence draw Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal directions of no ſmall moment; for that in many Chronical diſeaſes where the Dyſcraſies of the blood are more exactly to be ſought into, that the proportion and temperature of Salt and Sulphur may be truly found in it, it is ſometimes convenient to evaporate urines, or to diſtil them; ſomething alſo is to be learned from them, being precipitated, or looſned by putrefaction. I knew an honeſt Woman greatly afflicted with a ſcaly filthineſs of the skin, which ſhe was daily wont to ſcratch off in great plenty, as it were a branny matter. Her urine being evaporated in a little Skillet, left ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel, a cruſty and ſalt ſediment, like the excrement of her skin. Not long ſince I evaporated the urine of a Gentleman, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly ſubject to convulſive motions and painful ſtretchings out of the Muſcles, in the bottom of which there remained a quantity of ſalt and tartarous matter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the weight of half the liquor. By this means it will be an eaſie thing to find the proportion of the ſaline Principle in the blood and humours: but whether this Salt be volatile, or becomes fixed beyond meaſure, the diſtillation of the urine will preſently ſhew: For if the Spirit (ſo called) be copiouſly drawn out of the urine, and that beſides the Salt aſcends into the Alembeck, it is a ſign of volatilization: but the contrary to this argues the fixity of the Salt.</p>
                     <p>As the evaporation and diſtillation of the Urine ſhew the power of the ſaline Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo the precipitation, putrefaction, and Sulphur lay open the thicker contents of the Urine, as it were in weight and meaſure. As to the former, although the liquor of the urine be ſalt, and often big with contents, yet for as much as its ſaline Particles are not (as it is wont to be in moſt Menſtruums) either wholly in a ſtate of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107014:30"/>fixity, or of flux, but for the moſt part volatile, therefore it is not eaſily nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently by any ſalt infuſion ſubject to putrefaction; the Spirit of Vitriol and other acetous things effect nothing: the Salt of Tartar ſtirs up a little perturbation. But the ſolution of Alum, for that it greatly conſtrains into a little ſpace, preſently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the whole liquor extremely, and delivers all the contents of the urines, as they were thruſt out of their dens, to be ſeen openly by the eyes. Wherefore by this means, without any long ſtay for ſettlement, you may preſently know how much of ſulphureous and earthy matter is depoſed from the maſs of blood for recrements in the bottom.</p>
                     <p>The putrefaction of Urines is wont to exhibit the ſeveral particles of every kind, yet more diſtinct, and diſpoſed as it were by themſelves; for if the urine be left to ſtand unmoved for many days in the Glaſs, the colour, odour, and conſiſtency will be very much altered, for the colour will be deeper, the ſmell ungrateful, and highly ſtinking, the conſiſtency thicker, and will have on the ſuperficies a downineſs or hoarineſs, ſometimes whitiſh, ſometimes bluiſh; there will be alſo fixed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel a thick and copious ſediment, and often on the ſides a ſandy or tartareous cruſt, of a whitiſh or Aſh-colour. From theſe kind of appearances, and as the urines ſooner or later putrifie, and ſo are more or leſs altered from their former ſtate, it may be conjectured what the proportion of Salt or Sulphur may be, whether of them exceeds the other: alſo no unfaithful Judgment of the quality and plenty of the earthy matter or the contents may be taken from hence.</p>
                     <p>And thus, Sir, at length you have the Doctrine or Method of Separation of Urine, ſuch as our unskilfulneſs hath rendred it: I deſire you would be pleaſed not only to pardon the errours and barrenneſs of this Diſcourſe, but alſo to excuſe it in other things, becauſe at firſt writ by your perſwaſion, and then by your command and requeſt made publick. Wherefore pray take care of this child hardly brought forth and almoſt an abortive, and as it were expoſed and deſervedly laid at your door, without portion. Farewel.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is long ſince I deſigned to print my Meditations concerning the remaining Pathology of the Brain and Nervous ſtock: But when many Diſeaſes of that kind affect the animal Spirits, and not rarely the whole Hypoſtaſis of the corporeal Soul more immediately than the Humors or ſolid Parts; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it neceſſary firſt to publiſh the Diſquiſitions of the nature of this Soul, and its manner of ſubſiſting, and alſo of its Parts and Powers, that from theſe things rightly known, its preternatural Paſſions may at length be the better diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But concerning theſe very hard matters, and difficult to be unfolded, when I had begun to frame (as I think) probable and rational Arguments, I ſaw well that they would be looked upon and laughed at by ſome as unuſual things and Paradoxes; which indeed it becomes me not to take ill, but to let every one freely to enjoy his own ſenſe, and to uſe in all things his own opinion and judgment. Among the many things conjecturally propoſed by me, (which I could not avoid) two chief Arguments are oppoſed, to wit, that I had affirmed, that the blood for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of life was inkindled, and that the animal Spirits, for the motive act, were exploded: which terms, though perhaps they may ſound rough and ſtrange to be applied to the animal oeconomy; yet if any one ſhall weigh the Reaſons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which do perſwade to the truth of either opinion, I doubt not, but that there will be none who will not give their aſſent, or eaſily pardon me for mine. In the firſt place therefore, becauſe there are ſo many opinions concerning the growing hot of the Blood, for that ſome attribute it to an innate heat, others to a flame in the Heart, ſome alſo to a fermentation of the bloody maſs, and others to its inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; therefore I ſhall endeavour more narrowly to introſpect the matter, and as much as I am able, to build upon a more certain Ratiocination, its genuine Cauſe, though very abſtruſe.</p>
                     <p>We have formerly diſcourſed concerning that Soul, which is common to the more perfect Beaſts, with that ſubordinate or more inferiour of Man, and have ſhewed it to be indeed Corporeal, and to conſiſt of two parts; the one of theſe root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the blood we called a Flame, and the other dwelling in the Brain and nervous ſtock, Light. As we ſhall here only treat of the former, I think it will be no difficult matter to make uſe of the ſame Reaſons and Inſtances, which truly conclude, or at leaſt very like truth, that in the firſt place the blood is animate or hath life: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107014:31"/>that this Animation is in its accenſion or inkindling, or conſiſts in an affection moſt analogical to this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not only the opinions of Philoſophers, but the undoubted teſtimony of the Sacred Scripture plainly aſſerts the animation of the blood: to wit, the uſe of blood was forbidden in the Moſaical Law, for this reaſon, becauſe the Blood is the Life or Soul; which is alſo apparent by the obſervation of the moſt famous <hi>Harvey,</hi> for that its motion is to be obſerved by the eye, ſhews that it firſt lives and laſt dyes. For the greater proof of this, it is commonly known that Animals only live ſo long as the blood remains in its due plenty and motion; and that they preſently dye, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too great a quantity of this be taken away, or its motion ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>But as to the ſecond Propoſition, to wit, that the life or ſoul of the fervent blood depends upon its inkindling; this will appear probable, if I ſhall ſhew: Firſt, that the liquor of the blood ought to be very hot in the more perfect living Creatures. Secondly, that this growing hot can be produced or conſerved in the blood by no other means beſides accenſion or inkindling. Thirdly, that ſome chief affections, as it were proper paſſions of fire and flame, are agreeable to the life only of the blood growing hot. Fourthly and laſtly, theſe being clearly ſhewn, ſome other leſs ſignal accidents and properties, in which common flame and life agree, are added, and alſo we will unfold how and in what reſpect they differ among themſelves.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt we affirm, that the blood is perpetually moved in all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; beſides in the more perfect it doth eſtuate or grow hot in act. Indeed its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcontinued motion is required, both for the conſervation of the diſpoſition of the blood it ſelf, whoſe liquor would otherwiſe be ſubject to ſtagnation and putrefaction, as alſo that being carried about in the whole body, it might be able to give a due tribute to all parts. For that the offices of the blood, at leaſt in the more perfect living Creatures, are divers and manifold, <hi>viz.</hi> to inſtil matter in the Brain and nervous ſtock for the animal Spirits to diſpenſe the nutritious Juyce into all the ſolid parts, to ſuggeſt to the motive parts an elaſtic Copula, and beſides to ſeparate all recrements and worn out Particles, and to put them aſide into convenient Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>
                     <p>But although the mere motion of the Blood in leſs perfect Animals, or at leaſt its moderate ſwelling up, ſuch as may be perceived in Wine and other Liquors agitated into Fermentation, is able to ſuſtain and perform the oeconomy of Nature; to wit, for as much as both a crude nutriment is every where received from the river of the blood, though cool, continually flowing into all parts of the whole Body, and that fewer ſpirits and more thick, as it were ſeparated by percolation or ſtraining, enter the Brain and nervous ſtock with that plenty, that may ſuffice for local motion, and the Organs of the few ſenſes to be rudely actuated: yet the blood watering the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of more perfect Animals, require offices of a far more excellent kind; for it ought not only to be carried about with a continual and more rapid motion, but very much to ſwell up, yea actually to grow hot or effervent: to wit, for that end, that its frame or ſubſtance being very much looſned, it may more copiouſly ſend forth the reſpective Particles of various kinds, every where falling off from it, and may diſpoſe them here and there for the uſe and wants of Nature.</p>
                     <p>But firſt, for that the animal Spirits are continually to be ſupplied in great plenty from the maſs of blood, and that there is need for the elaſtic Particles requiſite for the locomotive function, to be thence perpetually poured into all the Muſcles, it ſeems very neceſſary that the liquor from whence theſe generous and manifold ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are drawn ſhould be actually hot, or rather ſhould burn forth; to wit, that the aforeſaid Particles, not ſufficiently to be unlocked but by heat or burning, ſhould freely run out from the ſubſtance or frame of the liquor: which truly is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, becauſe from Wine, and alſo from the ſame bloody Liquor, and all other ſpirituous things, a ſubtil and ſpirituous humour is copiouſly drawn, but not to be performed by diſtillation without heat or fire. Yea the ſulphureous Particles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are leſs apt to be exhaled from any Liquor, yet they moſt readily fly out by inkindling the ſubject. By theſe there is an apparent neceſſity of the blood's growing hot for the perfection of the animal as well as vital function; but that it may appear by what means this is done, to wit, whether by Accenſion, or by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by any other way, we ſhall firſt in general inquire, by what means, and for what cauſes any liquid things are wont to grow hot; then we ſhall conſider, to which of theſe the growing hot of the blood ought to be attributed.</p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:107014:32"/>
                     <p>Concerning theſe we ſay, that there are only three ways, or ſo many kinds of cauſes, by which Liquors conceive a heat, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, by fire or heat being put to them, as when water is made to ſeeth or boil over the fire, or that it grows hot by the heat of the Sun, a Bath, or Stove, or by the diſſolution of quick Lime; inſtances of all which are commonly known. For the ſame reaſon Bath-waters ſeem to boil. For, that we may inſtance in our own Baths, to wit, they are impregnated neither with Sulphur nor fixed Salt, as I have plainly experimented, by diſtilling and evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and by pouring into them precipitating Liquors; yea by diſſolving them with Sulphur, and many other ways. They moſt reſemble Lime-water, and they, as we believe, grow hot from a like cauſe, to wit, by imbibing the fiery little bodies ſomewhere hid within the Earth. Of theſe, unleſs it had been ſuperfluous, we had here given a fuller deſcription, which may perhaps be done at ſome other time. Secondly, when ſaline Corroſives, which are of a diverſe kind, being mingled with themſelves, or with ſulphureous things, work mutually one on another with a great ſtrife and agitation of Particles, and oftentimes excite heat, yea ſometimes fume and flame; as when the Spirit and Butter of Antimony are poured to, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtygian Water, wherein lixivial Salts are melted, or with Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or other diſtilled things; beſides when corroſive Liquors eat metallick Bodies, they often grow hot. Thirdly, and the only way beſides (as I ſuppoſe) whereby a liquid thing is made hot, is when any humour, being very much imbued with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or Spirit, conceives a burning by putting a flame to it, and ſo grows hot by burning forth. This is ordinarily ſeen in oily or very ſpirituous Liquors, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled and inflamed.</p>
                     <p>There remain indeed ſome other ways of Calefaction, to wit, Fermentation, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and Attrition, whereby more thick Bodies, or Solids, often conceive a fervour, but they produce not ſuch an effect in Liquids: whilſt the mealy Maſs or Dough is fermented, the active Particles being ſtirred up into motion, unfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on every ſide, and lift up the bulk or ſubſtance of the ſubject; in the mean time, for as much as the ſulphureous Particles being agitated with them, take hold one of another, and begin to be combined, a certain heat, though more remiſs, is excited; in like manner from Putrefaction, Dung or wet Hay get an heat, to wit, for as much as the ſulphureous Particles, within included, are very thickly heaped up together, then being combined together, they break out in troops: yet no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, either thin or thick, whether they ferment or putrifie, do for that reaſon at any time grow hot: For Wines, whilſt in fermenting they break in pieces the ſides of the Tun, or overflow the top of the Veſſel with a great noiſe and ebullition, do not actually grow hot, yea not ſo much as grow warm. The blood being let out of the Body, and placed in convenient Glaſſes, either to ferment or putrifie, doth not get any actual heat: yet in truth we grant the Blood in living Creatures to be fermented, and by fermenting to be putrified, yea and ſome other offices of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal oeconomy to perform the ſame: moreover, we have formerly ſhewed from its Fermentation being hindred, or too much increaſed, or otherwiſe depraved, divers kinds of diſeaſes to be produced: yet we deny the heat of the blood to be excited by Fermentation. Becauſe neither the blood of more frigid Animals, nor Wines, nor any other Liquors, though agitated with the higheſt Fermentation, are for that reaſon actually hot. And indeed the reaſon ſeems evident enough, to wit, becauſe the ſulphureous Particles being raiſed up in the more thick ſubjects, though they lay hold on one another mutually, and being more thickly heaped together, raiſe up heat: yet in Liquids, the ſame kind of Particles, however ſtirred up or agitated, are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately disjoyned by the watry coming between, and are hindred from their mutual embrace and combination; ſo that they cannot of themſelves produce an actual heat: For the ſame reaſon, hard Bodies being rubbed one againſt another, or violently knocked or bruiſed, do not only produce heat, but oftentimes fire; whenas yet Liquids, however ſhaken and agitated, do not grow warm. Therefore as there are only three ways, whereby actual heat may be begotten in all Liquors, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to which of theſe the heat of the Blood may be aſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some ſay it is the firſt way, from the opinion both of the Ancients, and of ſome of the Moderns: the Blood is ſaid to grow hot, by reaſon of ſome hot thing put to it, to wit, whilſt thoſe affirm an innate heat, and theſe a little flame to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Heart, and to heat the blood paſſing through it; but either of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions eaſily fails, from which it is clear, that the Heart is a mere Muſcle, nor doth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107014:32"/>contain in it ſelf any tinder or matter for a flame or heat (I know not how) implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fit for their continuance. For though it be confeſſed, that on the continual motion of this Bowel, (which is only animal) the Circulation of the Blood doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, yet the Heart borrows heat altogether from the blood, and not the blood from the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to what reſpects the ſecond way of making hot a liquid thing, to wit, whereby a great heat is excited by the mixing of ſaline Corroſives together, or alſo oily, or by corroding a metallick Body, I think there is none that will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly aſſert, that the blood grows hot from ſuch a cauſe; for that its liquor, in its natural ſtate, is always homogene, and although it be ſtuffed with plenty of Salt, it is however with that which is volatile, gentle, and benign only: But there is not to be found, either in the Heart, or in any other place a ſaline or any otherwiſe heterogene Mine, whereby the bloody liquor, by working or corroding, may get or conceive an heat: to wit, it behoves either ſuch a Mine or the Body to be corroded, to be perpetually renewed, becauſe the ebullition and heat raiſed up by the ſtrife of Salts, ceaſes as ſoon as the Salts are combined, or the Body corroded. If at any time the ſaline Particles of the humours in our Body depart from their right temper, and become enormous and unbridled, for that reaſon the blood, as to heat and motion, enters into ſome irregularities; yet it ſeems impoſſible, that it ſhould originally and perpetually become hot by the congreſſion, and ſtrife, or corroſion of the Salts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As to the third way, whereby Liquids are made hot, though it may ſeem an uncouth ſaying, That the blood is ſo inkindled, yet ſince we cannot attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to any other way beſides, what ſhould hinder from attributing its heat to this Cauſe? And the rather, for that the proper paſſions of Fire and Flame are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the life of the Blood alone.</p>
                     <p>For indeed theſe three things are chiefly and principally Eſſentials, requiſite for the perpetuating flame. Firſt, that there be granted to it, aſſoon as it is inkindled, a free and continued acceſſion of the Air. Secondly, that it may enjoy a conſtant ſulphureous food. Thirdly, that its recrements both ſooty, as alſo the more thick, be always ſent away. So then if I ſhall ſhew theſe things to agree after the ſame manner with life, as flame, and to thoſe only, without doubt, I think that life it ſelf may be eſteemed a certain kind of Flame.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, that a flame may be inkindled, and remain inkindled, there is need of a free and undiſcontinued acceſs of Air, and that not only, that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous Effluvia's, threatning the ſuffocation of the flame, may be carried away, and always depart, but much rather, that the nitrous food neceſſarily requiſite for the burning of any thing, may be ſupplied by the Air. For indeed every ſublunary fire, and eſpecially flame, is compounded or made up altogether of ſulphureous Particles, breaking out in heaps from a combuſtible Body, and of nitrous Bodies, which every where flow in the Air, meeting with them: when Particles of Sulphur, breaking out ſlowly or interruptedly, get to themſelves a few nitrous, only planted near them, a fire is uſually produced, ſuch as is ſeen in a burning Coal: But when the former going away more impetuouſly, either of their own accord, or forced by blowing, preſently lay hold on very many nitrous Particles flowing round about in the whole circuit, a flame ariſes. In truth the whole region of the Air is abundantly ſtuffed with nitrous little bodies, which are every where ready for the conſtituting of fire and flame, and they being any where inkindled, meet them after the manner of a flood, although not always after the like manner or meaſure, becauſe it is obſerved at ſome times, eſpecially in the Winter-cold, when the Air abounds more in Nitre, that fire or flame doth more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently burn, and diffuſe farther its heat: on the contrary, in rainy weather, as alſo when the beams of the Sun ſhine upon the fire, and ſo diſſipate the Nitre of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Air, the fire is ſo dull'd, as is commonly ſaid, that it is extinguiſhed by the Sun. If at any time the nitrous Particles of the Air are excluded from the ſulphureous of any ſubject breaking out in the inkindling or burning, the fire and flame quickly periſh; which appears, becauſe this or that being put into a Glaſs, after the Air is ſucked out or excluded, they preſently expire. Further, in the open Air, although a naked fire propagates a fire in a fireable matter by mere contact, yet a flame is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inkindled without a flame be put to it, or a very ſtrong fire: becauſe, for the ſtirring up of a flame very many nitrous Particles of the Air, implanted round about, ought to be inkindled at once; as if Nitre and common Sulphur being pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107014:33"/>together, be commixed (becauſe both Incentives agree) even the leaſt ſpark falling into ſuch a mixture begets an highly impetuous flame, which deſiring no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a nitrous food, is inkindled or burns under water, in a place void of air, or in any place as freely as in the open air. In like manner the leaſt ſulphureous things, as a bit of ponderous wood, being caſt into a red-hot Crucible, in which Nitre is fuſed, the ſame at firſt touch preſently conceive a flame, and continue till it be wholly conſumed: But that fire and flame being included in a place empty of air, expire by reaſon of the food of Nitre being drawn away, rather than choaked by their own proper ſmoke,
<note place="margin">

For a Candle being lighted, and put into a capacious globe of Glaſs, and the Veſſel ſtopped up: aſſoon as the air was ſucked out by a wind-inſtrument, the flame did expire. Moreover he obſerved, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for our Hypotheſis,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exper.</hi> 13.</note> that the flame contracted it ſelf according to all its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, aſſoon as ever the Engine began to ſuck, then after the ſecond or third draught of the drawn forth air, the flame about the utmoſt extremities appeared very blue, and to go back more and more from the Tallow, till at length getting to the top of the ſnuff it expired: the ſame Candle being again lighted, and ſhut up in the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, this worthy Gentleman tryed how long it was able to ſuſtain its light, when the air was not exhauſted, and he found it to endure much longer lighted than before. From theſe it clearly appears, that the flame ſhut up, expires not ſo much becauſe it is ſuffocated by its own proper ſmoke, as becauſe it is deſtitute of the nitrous food of the Air. For in the former Experiment the air being exhauſted, there was more ſpace for the ſmoke and ſume, that the flame might not be ſtifled, and yet this dyed ſooner, the Recipient being empty, than the ſame being full of air; beſides, the flame dying became bluiſh, for as much as it participated of more Sulphur than Nitre; and it left the Tallow, and expired at the top of the ſnuff, for that it followed its moſt neceſſary food as far as it was able,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exper.</hi> 78.</note> to wit, the nitrous Particles of Air. The ſame Experiment ſucceeded alike in live Coals, <hi>viz.</hi> the naked fire, after the food of Nitre was drawn away, ſuddenly dyed. Here alſo it doth what the flame of a Candle doth in Mines or Caves under ground, where the nitrous air is wanting or diſpelled, at firſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more contracted and blue, and then a little after expires.</p>
                     <p>I have been more large in this Argument, becauſe there is for both the like neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drawing in of the air, after the ſame manner, for the ſuſtaining the life of the Blood, and for the continuing of flame. For the more hot Animals, if they are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from reſpiration dye quickly, wherefore the ſame means of killing is moſt ready and common to ſhut up the breath, which being wholly obſtructed, life periſhes as a flame. If it ſhould be objected, that thoſe choaked do dye, becauſe the ſoot or ſmoke being retained, blow up and intumifie the bloody maſs, which for that reaſon, the bulk or ſubſtance being increaſed, and made almoſt immoveable, fills the boſom of the Heart, and hinders its motion: I ſay, that this is improbable, becauſe if the Arteries, every where in the Limbs and about the Neck, be ſtrained hard together with Ligatures, that the blood being ſtraitned as to the compaſs of its circuit, be very much ſtopped about the Praecordia, (more certainly than can happen from the mere retained ſmoke) yet for that cauſe death neither preſently follows, nor any deadly Symptoms. That this happens in thoſe that are hindred from reſpiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vital flame of the blood is wanting of the nitrous food of the Air, rather than overthrown by its proper ſoot or ſmoke being detained,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exper.</hi> 41.</note> the moſt Famous <hi>Boyl</hi> alſo by his Experiments hath put it out of doubt; for he hath obſerved, that hot living Creatures being put within a glaſſy Globe, and ſhut up, did far ſooner expire, the air being drawn away from them, than the ſame being left within it, though in the former caſe, there was more ſpace left for the receiving the ſmoke, leſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it might conſtipate the blood: yet however, if the heat of the blood ſhould ariſe from Fermentation, or the congreſſion of diſſimilar Particles, or from an ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of admitted heat, or from any other cauſe beſides accenſion, it is ſo far that that effect could be inhibited or ſuppreſſed by reaſon of the air being excluded, that on the contrary it would rather for that cauſe become more ſtrong or intenſe. For it appears, by a common obſervation, that Liquors chiefly ſermentable, the more ſtrictly they are kept in the Veſſel, the more they grow hot, and the air being admitted through ſome vent-hole, they preſently ceaſe from their fury. Moreover, Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi>'s Experiments clearly ſhew, that the efferveſcencies or growing fervent, ſtirred up by the ebullition of unlike Particles, or by corroſion, alſo the boiling up of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107014:33"/>hot water in a glaſſie Sphere, are above meaſure increaſed after the air is ſucked out, <hi>Experiment. Phyſicom.</hi> 41, 42, 43. That moſt ingenious Tract of the aforeſaid Author ſupplies us with many Experiments, whereby it is abundantly manifeſt, that the inteſtine motions of thoſe Particles, and almoſt of every thing, beſides fire and life, are very much heightned or made ſtrong in the ſpace emptied of air; but their act, preſently after the air is withdrawn, is extinguiſhed: hence we may conclude, the life of a living Creature to be either fire, or ſomething analogical to it. The like to theſe is yet more clearly obſerved by the diggers of Minerals, who ordinarily experiment in ſubterranean Caves, where either the Nitre is wanting, or is driven away by ſome ſtrange damp or vapour, ſo that they are in danger of being ſtifled or ſmothered, at the ſame time the flame of the Candle is diminiſhed, becomes blue, and at length expires.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing requiſite to ſuſtain a flame, is a conſtant ſupply of ſulphureous food, whereby it may continually be fed, which being ſubſtracted, or by reaſon of ſome incongruous mixture depraved, the flame is extinguiſhed; as is perceived in a Lamp, which for want of oyl, or water poured in its place, expires: further, as this ſulphureous food is more or leſs ſuggeſted, ſometimes more plentifully, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ſparingly, the flame being more or leſs intenſe, is ſometimes produced clear, ſometimes ſmoaky; in the mean time, the food being conſtantly conſumed by burning, goes away partly into vaporous Effluvia's, and partly into aſhes, which are made up of ſome Particles of Earth, Salt, and Sulphur: But it is much otherwiſe in Liquors expoſed to Fermentation, to which if new Particles be continually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and the old ones depart, the Fermentation is hindred or diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, as in Flame, the Blood of the hotter Animals (and this only in all natural things, beſides fire) requires a conſtant and copious ſulphureous food; and that being quickly worn, is for the moſt part conſumed in vaporous Effluvia's, a <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> being left of Earth, Salt, and ſtinking Sulphur: In the mean time from its food conſumed by burning, it diſpoſes other Particles for other uſes. That the life or flame of the blood doth continually want aliment, there is none but daily finds it in himſelf: For if that be for ſome time denied, the vigor of the blood is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea and conſuming the ſolid parts, it ſnatches into its boſom their remnants, and other humours of the Body whereby it may be fed. If the nutriment daily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted from things taken, be too thin and watry, the fervour of the blood, like flame without food, uſes to be remitted; but if the food be very ſulphureous and ſwelling with a vinous Spirit, and plentifully taken in, the blood is preſently infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and often breaks out into a Feaver, as it were an open burning. In the interim out of that food of the blood exhauſted or conſumed, as it ſeems by accenſion, hot Effluvia's full of ſoot and vapour go away, which according to a juſt account, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the other excrements of the Body; and that their nature is plainly fiery, the frequent burning of the mouth and tongue, and infecting them with blackneſs like the ſoot or ſmoke of a Chimney, witneſſes; beſides, from the inflamed blood aduſt Feces, like a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> are ſent into the Bladder of the Gall, Spleen, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps into other Emunctories.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That inkindled Flame may for ſome time continue, there is need of continual ventilation, to wit, that its ſooty Effluvia's may ſtill fly away, which elſe being detained and heaped together thereabouts, will ſuffocate the fire, becauſe by obſtructing the Pores of the inflamed Body, they hinder the eruption of the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matter to be inflamed. Although this condition doth often interfere with the other more potent, <hi>viz.</hi> the neceſſity of nitrous food to be ſo drawn in from the air, that it can ſcarce be diſtinguiſhed from it; yet we may plainly perceive, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſoot gathered together about the ſnuff, the light to be put out: for which cauſe a Lamp, whoſe wick is made of plumous Alum or other incombuſtible matter, will not (as it promiſes) endure any long time, becauſe the ſoot ſticking to the wick, hinders the acceſs of the oyl to the flame; for this reaſon blaſts of wind from the Air wiping away the ſootineſs, doth not only render the flame more clear, that is free from fume and thick vapour; but food being ſufficiently given to it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more durable.</p>
                     <p>Even as Flame, the life of the Blood requires alſo continual ventilation; to which end, beſides the greater breathing places of the Breaſt, innumerable leſſer, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pores of the skin gaping every where through the whole Body, do ſend forth Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's departing plentifully from the boiling blood; which if it happens to be hindred,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107014:34"/>or too cloſely ſhut up, the blood will grow exceſſively hot, being as it were beſet with fume and vapour: beſides, there is need to ſhorten its circuit, that paſſing through the Lungs with a more frequent turn, it might there, as much as it can, diſpel all its ſoot or ſmoak. When the Heavens are heated, the Air ſeems as it were immoveable and to ſtagnate, we are wont very much to eſtuate or grow hot about the Praecordia; for that the blood being fed with a more ſparing nitrous food, doth not burn ſo clearly, but glows with a more ſuffocating and intrinſick burning: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that the Particles of the Air being leſs nimble, when they are inſpired and expired or breathed forth, do not ſo readily convey away the vaporous Effluvia's of the blood; hence it is, that we fan the Air, that it may be made more moveable, and carry away more quickly and plentifully the ſoot or ſmoke from our Praecordia.</p>
                     <p>There yet remain ſome other ſmaller Conſiderations of Fire and Flame, reſpecting indeed not ſo much the Eſſence, as the production and extinction of either, which, whether and how far they may agree with the life of the Blood, we ſhall briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into.</p>
                     <p>Fire or Flame is produced two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either it is kindled from another fire or flame, or begot by an inteſtine motion of ſulphureous Particles. We have largely ſhewed the Species of either, and the manner of their being made, in our Tract of Fermentation (only we omitted there, that the acceſſion of nitrous food was neceſſary for the ſuſtaining it) even as flame, the life alſo of the hot or warm Blood, we have obſerved to be produced by a twofold way, to wit, it is either inkindled from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life or ſoul, as in Creatures that bring forth alive; or intrinſical Particles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to animation, are at length raiſed up to life with the blood by a long cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of external heat, as in oviparous or egg-laying Creatures.</p>
                     <p>If it be further demanded, when and how the vital Flame is kindled firſt in the Blood? I ſay, ſome ſmall beginnings of it are laid up from the conception it ſelf in the Genital humour, to wit, when the rudiment of the bodily Soul culled out from the Souls of the Parents, as a little ſpark ſtricken from thoſe flames, is hid in a convenient matter; which being from thence raiſed up by the Mothers heat, begins a little to glow and ſhine, and afterwards being daily dilated with the blood brought forth, and leiſurely increaſed, is equally extended with the Body, which it actuates and animates. But yet as long as the young one is included in the Egg or Womb, the vital fire, getting very little or ſcarce any aery food, doth not yet break out into open flame, but like a Brands end covered over with aſhes, burns only ſlowly and very little, and ſpreads abroad ſcarce any heat; wherefore both the formation and increaſe of the Embryo depends very much on the Mothers heat, or the cheriſhment of ſome other analogical thing, whereof being deſtitute it periſhes: but as ſoon as the young one is born in due time, and begins to breathe, the vital fire preſently receiving the nitrous food, largely unfolds it ſelf, and an heat or efferveſcency being raiſed up through the whole bloody maſs, it inkindles a certain flame; and becauſe the blood then firſt ruſhing into the Lungs, having there gotten an acceſſion of Air, begins to burn, the fleſh of that Bowel, at firſt reddiſh, is ſhortly changed into a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colour, like burnt aſhes, and the blood it ſelf undergoes a notable alteration; for what did flow of a dark Purple colour into the Pneumonick Veſſels from the right ſide of the Heart, returning from thence preſently out of the Lungs, becomes Crimſon, and as it were of a flame-colour, and ſo ſhining, paſſes through the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart and the appending Arteries.</p>
                     <p>Indeed that in Creatures new-born, the colour of the Lungs is ſo ſuddenly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I think it ought to be attributed to the blood, there at firſt more openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, and their fleſh as it were ſomewhat roaſted; although the mere inflation of the Lungs in a dead Embryo produces the like effect, becauſe the Membranes of the Lungs and the Parenchyma being diſtended and increaſed into a greater capacity, ſhake off the ſtagnating blood, and ſo draw it away into little and ſcarce to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rivulets.</p>
                     <p>As to the Colour of the Blood, ſo variouſly changed into circulating from a dark purple to a crimſon, and from this to that, I ſay, that the immediate cauſe of this is, the admixtion of the nitrous Air with the Blood; which certainly appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the change into a crimſon, begins in that place where the blood chiefly gets the acceſs of the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt it is transferred out of the Arteries into the Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Veins; for in thoſe it appears of a dark Purple, in theſe every where florid, as the moſt Learned Doctor <hi>Lower</hi> hath obſerved. Further, it yet farther appears,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107014:34"/>that this alteration of the colour proceeds from the admixture of the Air, becauſe that crimſon colour follows in the ſuperficies of all blood, let out of the Veſſels by reaſon of its meeting or mingling with air; and if the flowering or top be taken away, another preſently ariſes. Beſides, the blood being let out of a Vein, and very much ſtruck with a ſwitch or rod, it becomes crimſon through all: and in like manner the blood of living Creatures ſhines at firſt within the Pneumonick Veins, to wit, preſently after the influx of the air by the Wind-pipe; and from thence, by reaſon of the ſame Particles of inkindled air being yet retained, it paſſes through all the Arteries ſtill florid; in the mean time, from the Nitre of the Air mingled with the ſulphureous Particles, and burning with them, the blood being greatly rarified, and in truth expanded into flame, impetuouſly ſwells up within all the paſſages of the Pneumonick Vein and the great Artery, ſending from it ſelf copious breaths and hot Effluvia's; but being dilated towards the ends of the Arteries, and returning towards the Heart, that it may enter more cloſely into the little mouths of the Veins, it lays aſide its turgid and burning aery Particles, and being preſently made more quiet and half extinct, and ſo both its vigour and alſo its colour being changed, it returns through the paſſages of the Veins, that at length running into the Lungs, it might renew its burning. After this manner, that the inkindled blood might flame through the whole Body with a perpetual and equal flame, and ſucceſſively renew its burning in all its Particles, it ought to be carried about by a perpetual courſe from the neſt of its accenſion into all parts, and from theſe to that. For this end the Machine or Engine of the Heart was needful, as a Pin or Cock, which being made with a double boſom, might receive in it ſelf from the whole Lungs the blood freſh inkindled, that it might preſently drive forward, whilſt burning, into every part of the whole Body, and might then receive the burnt and half extinguiſhed blood returning from the whole Body; which being imbued with new inflammable juyce, it might deliver to the Lungs to be re-inkindled.</p>
                     <p>In performing this task, although the Heart be a mere Muſcle, and exerciſed only with an animal motion, ſeems to ſerve alone for the Circulation of the Blood; yet in the mean time, it ſo much helps to moderate the accenſion of the blood and its burning, according to the rage of the paſſions, and to direct other works and uſes of the animated Body, that we have thought the vital or flamy part of the Soul to have its chief, and as it were Imperial ſeat in the Heart and Lungs, in every diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or affection, as of Grief, Joy, Fear, and the like; alſo in the fits of Diſeaſes, the Heart is diſpoſed after a various manner, and hence it comes to paſs, that the blood flowing in fluctuates, and is inkindled with a diverſe rage; of which there will be a more opportune place of diſcourſing, when we ſhall treat of the Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we conſider that the burning of the Blood, and for that reaſon the vital or flamy part of the Corporeal Soul doth not appear lively or vigorous in all, nor ever after the ſame manner or meaſure; yet it exiſts according to the various conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the blood, to wit, as it is more or leſs ſulphureous, ſpirituous, faltiſh, or watry, yea and according to the divers conſtitutions and conformations both of the food, with which this flame is nouriſhed, as alſo of the little ſpiracles or breathing holes, by which it is eventilated; and further; of the Heart it ſelf, whereby it is agitated and driven about here and there; the accenſion of blood varies alſo in every one, by means of ſeveral other accidents, to wit, as its flame is ſometimes great, clear, and expanded, ſometimes ſmall, contracted, or cloudy, ſometimes equal and in order, ſometimes unequal and often interrupted, yea and it becomes ſubject to many other mutations; alſo becauſe the Soul it ſelf having gotten a various nature or diſpoſition, it conceives divers affections and manners, whereof we ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; for as much as it is not a little thing, that the diſpoſition of the whole Soul depends upon the temperament of the bloody maſs, and the degree and manner of its accenſion or inkindling.</p>
                     <p>It clearly appears, from what hath been ſaid, that Fire and Life do dye or are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed alike many ways, to wit, there is an end of either, if the acceſs of nitrous food, or the departure of Effluvia's be hindred, or if the oily or ſulphureous aliment, requiſite to either, be conſumed, too much withdrawn, or perverted from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable diſpoſition; of each whereof it is ſo clearly apparent, that there needs no farther explication.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have ſhewn, that the Life of the Blood, or that part of the Soul grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, is a certain kind of Flame; let us now ſee by what means it is diſpoſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107014:35"/>to burning, and how near it comes to the ſimilitude of a burning Candle or Lamp.</p>
                     <p>A common Lamp, whether deſigned to give heat or light, for the moſt part is wont to be made after this manner; to wit, the Oyl flowing perpetually to the wick, gives continual food to the flame; wherefore as there is but one fire-place or hearth only of light and heat, the action of either is limited only to one place, and ſo as often as there is need of more places at once, or divers parts of the ſame ſpace or body to be illuminated or made warm, we place here and there divers lighted Candles or Lamps. But if an Inſtrument made with great artifice (ſuch as is truly an animated Body) with one liquor only contained in it, ſhould be made hot throughout the whole, and to be kept always warm, it ought not only to be lightly inkindled in the wick, but in the whole ſuperficies, and derived by fit Tubes or Pipes to all the parts of the Machine, then the burning liquor ought to enjoy, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to all its parts, an acceſs of nitrous Air, and to lay aſide Effluvia's and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and ought alſo to have a ſupply of that conſtant expence: theſe kind of offices are not to be performed any where up and down, but only in ſome ſet places; therefore the burning liquor ought to be carried about through the whole with a perpetual turn, that all its portions might enjoy ſucceſſively all thoſe priviledges, and at once heat the whole capacity of the containing Machine, to wit, both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward receſſes. Indeed ſuch a Bannian or Bathing Engine, artificially made, might aptly repreſent the real Divine handy-work of the Circulation of Blood, and what burns in it, the Life-lamp.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, that the Blood ſeems not to be inflammable of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; further, ſince there is no flame of this heat or effervency to be beheld with the eyes, it may well be doubted, whether there be ſuch a thing or no. I ſay firſt, That the Chymical Analyſis of the blood ſhews very many particles of Sulphur and of Spirit, yea a plentiful ſtock of inflammable Oyl, which are however mixed with other more thick Elements, in a juſt proportion, to bridle their too great inkindling; to wit, that this liquor might flame out by little and little, and only through fewer parts, for the conſtituting of a benign and gentle Lamp of life: wherefore the blood being let out of a Vein upon a burning fire, doth in ſome meaſure burn, though it is not like the Spirits of Wine, or Oyl of Turpentine turning all into a flame; beſides, the whole maſs of blood, as the Oyl of a Lamp, ought not to be fired; yea its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is inſtituted for that end, that whilſt all the Particles of the Mixture being freed, ſome ſulphureous and ſpirituous are conſumed by burning, others more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til being ſent in Troops, might ſerve for the neceſſary uſes of the animal Regiment; and alſo others more thick or craſs and nouriſhing, as it were boiled or roaſted, might be diſpenſed for the cheriſhing all parts; beſides, that all the dead, or worn out, and excrementitious may be ſent away by fit or convenient ſinks, and others conſtantly ſubſtituted in their places by nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>But in the interim, that the vital Flame, which deſtinated to ſo many offices, we ſuppoſe to be inkindled in the Blood, (otherwiſe than the common flame, which is plainly conſpicuous) appears not at all, a probable reaſon thereof may be given; as it is moſt thin, and burns in the Heart, and its depending Veſſels as it were ſhut up in Receptacles, it doth not clearly flame out, but perhaps remains in the form of ſmoke, or a vapour, or breath; yea, although the blood ſhould openly flame out, yet it might be ſo done, that its ſhining being moſt thin, may not be perceived by our ſight, as in the clear light of the day we cannot behold a glowing red-hot Iron, nor ſhining ſparks, nor falſe fires, nor rotten wood, nor many other things ſhining by night; why then may not the vital fire, even thinner than they, quite eſcape our ſight? Although ſometimes hot living Creatures uſe to ſend forth a certain fire or flame only conſpicuous by night: For we have known in ſome endued with a hot and vaporous blood, when they have put off their inner garments at night going to bed near a fire or Candle, a very thin and ſhining flame to have ſhewn it ſelf, which hath poſſeſſed the whole inferiour region of the Body. The reaſon of which affection ſeems wholly the ſame, as when the evaporating fume of a Torch juſt put out is again inflamed by a light inkindling, and manifeſtly argues that another flame, the root of this extrinſick one, lyes hid within the Body. For this very cauſe it is, that from the Mains of Horſes, and the Skins of Cats, or other hot Animals being ſhaken, little ſparks as it were of fire leap out, and often flames, only conſpicuous in the dark, ariſe. Beſides, we here take notice in a burning Feaver, cauſed by immoderate drinking of Wine or ſtrong Waters, that the blood, as the flame of it is very much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107014:35"/>increaſed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oth grow exceſſively hot, and ſuch are wont to emit dry breaths, and ſharp Effluvia's of heat, not like thoſe that proceed from fermenting or boiling Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, but only inflamed. That which ſome in Feavers have imagined to have ſeen or obſerved even burning fires and flame in the eyes, argues indeed that the flame of the blood is very ſtrong, and alſo that it penetrates the incloſure of the Brain. I knew a certain ingenious Man of a very hot brain, who affirmed, that after a very plentiful drinking of Wine, he was able in the darkeſt night to read clearly; from hence alſo may be collected, how the accenſion of the blood, like that of burning Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, is to be increaſed or made ſtronger, <hi>viz.</hi> by an agitation of the parts, and a more plentiful affuſion of ſulphureous food.</p>
                     <p>But that in the hot blood of living Creatures, the Properties, Affections, and many other accidents of Fire or flame are found without the manifeſt form or ſpecies of it; what if we ſhould ſay the cauſe to be, for that the vital flame of the blood is ſubjugated, or made ſubordinate to another form, <hi>viz.</hi> to the corporeal Soul? Wherefore, although it retains the chief qualities and affections of common flame, yet it loſes the ſpecies of flame or fire; for in every natural mixture, the ſuperiour form exerciſes a Right and Dominion over all included Particles whatſoever, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fierce and untameable they may be in themſelves, and ſtripping them of their ſpecies, ordains and diſpoſes them to peculiar actions in that proper Concrete: when the form of fire excels, that bright burning, that it might propagate large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its ends, deſtroys and conſumes all inflammable objects. But if the form of the corporeal Soul be induced upon the fire, kindled within the blood, it burns forth without fulgor or ſhining, or deſtruction of the ſubject, and is inviſible, and as it were ſubjugated flame, is ordained for the ſuſtaining of life and its offices: but truly the Divine Providence, from the very Creation of the World, hath ſeemed to have predeſtinated Forms to natural Bodies, to wit, that they might remain as ſo many Figures or Types, according to which every portion of matter framing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, whether animate or inanimate, might be modificated; ſo that the Maſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the virtues of the hidden Seeds, being diſpoſed after this or that manner, happens to have the form of a Stone, a Plant, or Brute, or of any other kind; then the acts and affections, appropriate to ſuch a Species, follow the form it ſelf. When therefore Life or Soul is deſtinated to theſe kind of Functions of the more perfect Animals, for the performing of which, the blood, after the manner of burning Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, ought to be perpetually hot, and as it were inkindled; what ſhould hinder, but that the act of Life, or of that corporeal Soul (conſiſting in the motion and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomeration or heaping together of moſt ſubtil and agil Particles) may be called a certain Burning or perpetual Fire of the bloody Maſs? Wherein although the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and chief qualities of common fire are implanted, yet the form of fire is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, as being ſubjugated to a more noble form, <hi>viz.</hi> of the corporeal Soul: not much unlike water, which being congealed into Ice or Snow, lays aſide the ſpecies of water for a time, and may be applied to other uſes far diſtant from fluidity.</p>
                     <p>But truly, though we affirm, that the corporeal Soul doth ſtick in the Blood, yet we do not, that it is adequated or limited to it: becauſe whilſt the more thick portion of it, as the Roots of ſome Tree, fixed in the Earth, are ſowed in the bloody Maſs, the more noble part of the ſame Soul, as the higher branches, are expanded in the Brain and nervous Syſtem; or as we before hinted, when the vital or flamy part of the Soul is contained in the blood, the animal or lucid portion of it is contained in the Head and its Appendix; by which juſt limit the Sphere of either may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, neither may the vital flame impetuouſly break through the animal Region, the ſubſtance of the Brain being more cold, and alſo ſhining or bright, is oppoſed to it, as it were an icy or glaſſie Bar, whoſe interiour frame or ſubſtance, the ſmall and ſlender as it were rivers of the blood, for the ſake of cheriſhing heat, can enter: but truly ſpirituous Particles plentifully flow from its juyce or liquor, every where heaped up near the confines of the Brain, and there diſpoſed as it were to be ſtilled forth, which being immerſed in the Brain, and more exalted, affords matter, out of which the animal Spirits are procreated, to be derived through the Nerves into the various Regions of the Body.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>AS there are two chief or primary Faculties of the Corporeal Soul, to wit, the Senſitive and Motive, we have aſſigned certain exteriour Powers of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, which are chiefly acted in the Nervous ſtock, and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, the Exerciſes of which lye within the Brain, to wit, ſuch as the Imagination, Memory, Appetite, &amp;c. What we have publickly diſcourſed of ſome time ſince both concerning internal and external Senſes, may perhaps hereafter be brought to light and made publick: in the mean time, becauſe I am oppoſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both the natural and convulſive Motion, I think it fit at preſent to publiſh what I had meditated touching the Motive power, and what Hypotheſis I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of ſo hard and highly intricate a thing.</p>
                     <p>The motive Faculty of the bodily Soul is wont to be exerciſed with another kind of Action than the ſenſitive, <hi>viz.</hi> with a diverſe aſpect and tendency of animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For that every Senſe is a certain paſſion, wherein the Soul, or ſome portion of it, being outwardly ſtruck, is forced to nod or ſhake, and a wavering of the Spirits being inwardly made to look back towards the Head; but on the contrary, every Motion is a certain Action wherein the Soul ſeems to exert it ſelf whole, or part of it ſelf, and by a declination or fluctuation of Spirits being made to bring forth a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis, and to extend ſomething as it were its member. Further, whilſt the Soul ſo exerts it ſelf, or ſome part of it ſelf, that the works then deſigned might be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, an heap of animal Spirits being every where diſpoſed in the motive parts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, ſometimes more are raiſed up by the Soul, which by that means being expanded with a certain force, and as it were exploded, they blow up the containing bodies, and ſo the ſame being increaſed as to their thickneſs, and made ſhort as to their length, are made to attract the adjoyning member, and ſtir up local motion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In every motion, theſe three things ought to be conſidered: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, the original of the Action, or the firſt deſignation of the Motion to be performed, which is always in the Brain or Cerebel. Secondly, its inſtinct or tranſmiſſion of the thing begun to the motive parts, which is performed by the commerce of the Spirits lying within the Nerves. Thirdly, the motive force it ſelf, or exertion of the Spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the moving parts, either into a contractive or elaſtick force. From this threefold Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> as the buſineſs is performed in every one of theſe in a various manner, very many kinds and differences of Motions are deduced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the original or beginning of Motion, we ſhall take notice, that that which proceeds from the Brain, with a knowing and auſpicious appetite, may be called Spontaneous or Voluntary; but that which is wont to be excited from the Cerebel, where the Law of Nature preſides, ſuch as are Reſpiration, the Pulſe, with many others, may be called merely Natural, or Involuntary: either of theſe is either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, which is ſtirred up of it ſelf, or primarily from this or that beginning, as often as the appetite requires this or that thing, out of a certain proper, and as I may ſay, inteſtine deliberation, and chuſes out reſpective motions; ſo in like manner, when the ordinary offices of the natural and vital Function are performed, according to the ſolemn Rite of Nature; or the motion of either kind is reflected, to wit, which depending on a previous ſenſe more immediately, as an evident cauſe or occaſion, is preſently retorted; ſo a gentle titillation of the Skin cauſes a rubbing of it, and the more intenſe heats of the Praecordia ſtir up the Pulſe and Reſpiration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Vehicle of the Inſtinct, which we ſuppoſe to be wholly done by the Nerves, for as much as it is performed by a ſingle Nerve, or by more at once, it is called either a Simple or Complicate Motion; then for that ſome Nerves help mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more or leſs than others by ſooner or later moving, this or that member is ſaid to be moved firſt, or by it ſelf, and another by conſent: yea, and that conſent is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107014:36"/>wont to be acted or done with neighbouring or more remote parts, and that with a diverſe reſpect: But we have in another place largely ſhewn inſtances of theſe kind of ſympathetick motions, as alſo the cauſes of each of them, and their manner of being made.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is another, and that a remarkable diſtinction of Motions, taken from the various conſtitution of the moving parts: to wit, parts endued with nervous Fibres, and in which the motive Spirits dwell; either they are Muſcles, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form local motions; or membranaceous bodies, the motions of which are terminated in themſelves, which therefore we call Inteſtine. As to what belongs to local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which only we treat at preſent, although it be confeſſed by all, that the Brain or Cerebel, and the Nerves and Muſcles together one or more, as it were with joynt forces, do contribute to this motion; alſo, though it may be ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the beginning of the motion to be performed is deſigned in the Brain or Cerebel, and that its inſtinct is conveyed wholly by the Nerves; yet by what means the Muſcles perform that work, far exceeding any mechanick virtue or operation, ſeems moſt hard to be made plain.</p>
                     <p>That local Motion is performed by traction, and doth depend upon the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Muſcle, is not only a vulgar Opinion, but is alſo plain by ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; yet it is very much diſputed and variouſly controverted among Authors concerning the manner of Contraction and efficient Cauſe; ſome think it enough to ſay, that the Soul it ſelf, by its preſence, doth actuate the Muſcle, or contract or draw out here and there its Fibres, as it were a net ſpread forth. But indeed this is to attribute to the ſenſitive Soul a ſupernatural, and as it were Divine virtue. To wit, that the ſame, by its mere Spirit, was able to bend and force heavy and very great bodies whither it pleaſes. Further, for what end are the motive Organs fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with wonderful artifice and manifold difference, unleſs that after the manner of Machines, they might perform their operations by an orderly ſtructure, and as it were mechanical proviſion of parts? Truly it will be no hard thing to apply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of a Muſcle and of the whole nervous Function, and to explicate them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules, Canons, and Laws of a Mechanick. Before I enter upon this, I think it not amiſs firſt to ſpeak ſomething of the make, conformation, and uſe of a Muſcle in general. The ancient Anatomiſts, almoſt all with one conſent, did divide the body of a Muſcle into Head, Belly, and Tail; taking for the Head the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Muſcle connexed to the part, to which contraction is made; for the Tail, the end or portion of the Muſcle inſerted to the part to be moved; for the Belly, the part of the Muſcle coming between, which is beheld more tumid, with a bulk of fleſh; then for the performing of motion, they did ſuppoſe the Muſcle to ſwell up about the Head and Belly, and ſo to grow ſhort as to its length, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract nearer to it ſelf the hanging part; yet by what means, and for what cauſe the belly of the Muſcle ſwells up, none yet hath clearly unfolded.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, although the Doctrine of the Nerves hath been much deſcribed by the moſt skilful Anatomiſts of every Age, ſo that the Muſcles of the whole Body (as it is thought) have been exactly recounted, and offices aſſigned them, and monſtrous names fitted for the expreſſing them, yet the true frame of a Muſcle, not yet ſhewed by others, firſt began to be delivered lately by the moſt ingenious Doctor <hi>Steno.</hi> He hath found out in every Muſcle two oppoſite Tendons, into which both the Fibres go; yea, and hath taught, that the ſame Fibres wholly, which compoſe ſtrictly on one ſide, the Tendon of the knitting being more looſly joyned, do conſtitute the fleſh; yet ſo, that ſome being laid upon others, compoſe the thickneſs or profundity of the Muſcle, and ſome laid nigh to others, its breadth or latitude: he calls the former Fibres <hi>Ordines</hi> or Orders, but the other <hi>Verſus</hi> or Turnings; then the parts and compoſition of a Muſcle being after this manner laid open, he aptly reduces its Figure to Mathematical Rules, and according to Canons thence taken, ſhews the action to be unfolded: becauſe he advertiſing, that in a Muſcle with a ſimple right line, all the fleſhy Fibres, parallel within themſelves, and for the moſt part equal, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from one Tendon obliquely into another; and that thoſe Tendons are ſowed in the oppoſite ends or angles of the fleſh, whereby he moſt ingeniouſly deſcribes a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be, <hi>a Collection of moving Fibres, ſo framed together, that the middle fleſh conſtitute an oblique angular Parallelopipedum, but the oppoſite Tendons compoſe two quadrangular Priſms or Figures.</hi> The Inſtrument which Painters uſe for the deſcribing many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ſame thing, fitly repreſents the figure of this delineated in a plain: becauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107014:37"/>the ſtyles being fixed to the oppoſite Angles, expreſs the inſertions of the Tendons and the Parallelogram it ſelf the fleſhy part of the Muſcle: for when the oppoſite Angles are diduced to a great diſtance from one another, and made ſharper, the two ſides come nearer together, and render the <hi>Area</hi> or middle of the Figure longer, but narrower, a Muſcle not contracted is denoted: But if the ſame Angles are brought nearer, and made more obtuſe, the two ſides go farther apart, and ſo make the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Muſcle ſhorter, but alſo wider, a contracted Muſcle ſeems to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. In the mean time, in either ſite of the aforeſaid Parallelogram the quantity or longitude of the ſides is not changed, but only their poſition, and the largeneſs of the Angles is varied: whether it may be alſo ſo in a Muſcle, ſhall hereafter appear. In the mean time we ſhall take notice, out of the obſervation of the ſame moſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Steno,</hi> that a Muſcle is either ſimple, which conſiſts of one belly and two Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, of which ſort there are many in the Arm and Leg, which are the movers of the fingers and toes, yea and almoſt every where in other parts of the Body; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that hath many bellies, to every one of which, two oppoſite Tendons are hung; yet ſo, as when thoſe compounded Tendons, to wit, two together, ſhall be joyned, one compound Tendon enters the middle of the fleſh, and the other embraces the middle on both parts. This is evidently diſcerned in the Maſſeter or Throat-muſcle, the Deltoid, and divers others, in all which, even as in a ſimple Muſcle, whilſt the fleſhy Fibres (to which only the motive power belongs) are contracted, the oppoſite Angles are enlarged according to the inſertions of the Tendons, and ſo the bellies being made ſhorter, and at the ſame time thicker, do ſwell up.</p>
                     <p>In a ſimple Muſcle, according as one Tendon or both together, or either by turns, ought to be drawn; beſides, according as the part to be drawn is thin, or broad, or planted near or far off, and for ſeveral other reſpects the fleſhy belly is diverſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and as the Rhomboides is its chiefeſt regular figure, yet that alſo is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times triangular, ſometimes trapezial or quadrangular, pyramidal, ſpiral, ſemilunar or like an Half-moon, or of ſome other irregular form. But in all theſe kind of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the fleſhy Fibres, according to all their poſitions, whilſt they are contracted, at the ſame time intumifie or ſwell up, and are ſhortned from either end towards the middle, though in all Muſcles not always in a like manner and dimenſion; for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tendon be to be drawn at once, the contraction from either fleſhy end, is for the moſt part equal; but at the ſame time, if one only be drawn from the others that are immoveable, the contraction is made leſs, and ſometimes, <hi>viz.</hi> where the fleſh immediately ſticks to the bone without any notable Tendon, almoſt none.</p>
                     <p>The compounded Muſcles are diſtinguiſhed with a fear greater variety; for beſides their diverſity of figures, all which would be an immenſe labour to enumerate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are more or leſs compounded, or have their bellies more or fewer, with a manifold Series ſtretched out here and there, with Fibres ſometimes of the ſame, ſometimes of a divers order, they are very much differenced.</p>
                     <p>The more thin and leſs compounded Muſcle, when perhaps it is ſorted into two or three bellies, diſpoſed in the ſame being plain, hath the ſeries of fleſhy Fibres for the moſt part looking diverſly, all the exteriour Tendons embracing one end of the Muſcle, and hath the others intermediate or that come between immerſed about the other end; ſo that the ſeveral fleſhy Fibres of every Belly lye parallel between the one extreme Tendon and the other intermediate Tendon. The thicker and more compounded Muſcle, that it might perform at once quick, hard, and long motions, hath many bellies planted in divers plains, and the ſeries of fleſhy Fibres (which are all ſhort) looking many ways. The frame of them, although it be very intricate, that one can ſcarce number all the bellies, much leſs obſerve their habitudes, mutual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and means of connexions among themſelves; yet they may in ſome ſort be reduced to this common Rule in moſt, to wit, in the great compounded Muſcles, ſuch as are thoſe round ones which contribute mighty ſtrength and elaſtick force to the middle of the Arms and Legs, we may take notice, in one end of two vaſt exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Tendons covering almoſt the whole ſuperficies of the Muſcle, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided preſently into many fiſſures or clefts, are ſtretched out between a broad ſhoot or claw to the other extremity of the Muſcle; then on the oppoſite ſide, about this other end, a great Tendon enters the middle of the fleſh, which alſo is cleft or divided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into many laps, diſtributed through the whole interiour belly of the Muſcle. And as theſe interiour lamens or laps meeting with the exteriour, and being ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out almoſt to the oppoſite end, look many ways, and have their ſuperficies turning
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107014:37"/>on every ſide, ſome every where are deſtinated to others oppoſite, and are committed or ſent through the intervenient ſeries of the fleſhy Fibres: ſuch a Muſcle, whoſe very many bellies being planted in divers plains, do look many ways, can by no manner or way be cleft or pulled aſunder, but that the other ſeries of fleſhy Fibres muſt be broke aſunder in the midſt. The bellies of a Muſcle, ſo very much compounded, although manifold, yet are very ſlender, ſo that the fleſhy Fibres thereof being moſt ſhort, and having their Angles always equal, but oblique, with the tendinous laps, for that cauſe make a moſt ſtrong attraction. Becauſe the numerous ſeries of fleſhy Fibres ſeem as it were ſo many diſtinct poſts or ſupporters ſet together for the moving of any weight, or rather, for that either great Tendon is preſently ſo cut into many lappets, it is like, as if a mighty draw-rope, hung for the drawing up a body, ſhould be preſently divided into many little ropes or cords, by which many men might draw at once. For whilſt the ſeveral ſeries of the fleſhy Fibres are ſhortned at once, they draw the oppoſite Angles of all the tendinous lappets together, and ſo the belly of the whole Muſcle being intumified or ſwelled up, they ſtrongly draw either end, or that which is moveable towards the middle.</p>
                     <p>On every Muſcle, both ſimple and compound, there is ſtretched on every ſide a membranaceous covering; beſides, other little Fibres tranſverſe, to wit, membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous, are woven between the direct moving fleſhy Fibres of every one, which clothe each of them, and keep or faſten them together, yea (as it ſeems probable) they both communicate to all the fleſhy Fibres the ſame inſtinct of obeying the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo carry to the Tendons, the troops of the inflowing Spirits, received from the Nerve.</p>
                     <p>The Arteries and Veins, inſerted in the middle of every Muſcle, ſend forth little branches on all ſides, obliquely cutting the moving Fibres, from which leſſer bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diſperſed between the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the fleſh, water them all with a flux or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the blood. But the Nerve entring the fleſhy belly of every one, diſtributes ſome ſmaller circles only in the neighbouring parts, as it were bearing only the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol or mark of the commanded action, commands the execution of it to the Guard or inferiour Company of the fleſhy Fibres and membranaceous Fibrils.</p>
                     <p>I had deſigned Figures, almoſt of every kind of Muſcles to be engraved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural appearances: but the Printer making haſte, I had not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſſect an humane Body, having only taken ſome few Muſcles from the Leg of an Ox, we have cauſed them to be delineated to the life, which are to be ſeen at the end, although the famous <hi>Steno</hi> hath already accurately performed this task. Which Figures, if any one think too much bending to Mathematical Rules, he may with an eaſie labour behold the ſame Conformation of a Muſcle, as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it in the fleſh it ſelf. For if a ſimple regular Muſcle be cut out of any Animal, and ſo placed, that the Tendons here and there be held on the ſides, the fleſhy Fibres between them intercepted in oblique and equal Angles, be preſſed upon an Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal plain, the fleſh will be exactly like a Rhomboides or an oblique angular Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipedum. Then if the ſite of the ſame Muſcle being changed, and its Tendons placed above and below, you ſhall cut long-ways the inferiour Tendon, and pull the parts one from another, and divide by tearing the whole Muſcle into two parts, you ſhall preſently ſee a moſt elegant ſpectacle, all the fleſhy Fibres diſpoſed in one ſeries, yea and parallel between themſelves, and of the ſame longitude, to proceed from one Tendon into another, and to make both Angles always oblique and equal; although we cannot cleave after this manner the compounded Muſcles, whoſe manifold bellies have a diverſe plain, yet it will eaſily appear, to one curiouſly cutting them, either raw or boiled, two Tendons to be fitted to each Parallelogram of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the action of a Muſcle, we plainly ſaw in diſſected living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (which only ſhew this) that it is contracted, yet not ſo as the old Opinion declared, to wit, that the Fibres being contracted from the end towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, one extremity of the Muſcle was carried towards the other; but the fleſhy Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres only and their ends are ſeen to be contracted towards the middle, the Tendons being ſtill unchanged and altered neither as to their longitude or thickneſs: which thing alſo the moſt Learned <hi>Steno</hi> did firſt of all obſerve long ſince. This is clearly perceived in the Diaphragma and the Muſcles dedicated for Reſpiration, which are moved with a conſtant change: for as often as the Muſcle is contracted, you may behold all the fleſhy Fibres, in either extremity, to be pulled together at once, and as if they would enter on either ſide one another to be carried nearer, and ſo at once to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107014:38"/>become ſhorter and thicker, then from that conſtriction to return looſe to their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed longitude and ſlenderneſs. Whilſt you behold this to be ſo done, you will eaſily think, that ſomething, to wit, ſpirit or ſubtil matter doth flow from the Tendons into the fleſh or fleſhy Fibres, which entring them on either ſide, blows them up, and at the ſame time draws them together nearer within themſelves, that preſently all the Fibres are made ſhorter and intumified; then when that matter recedes from the fleſh or fleſhy Fibres into the Tendons, the Fibres being emptied and looſned from their corrugation or wrinkling, are reſtored to their former longitude, and ſo by turns: whether this in truth be ſo done or no, ſhall be diſcourſed anon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, that we may proceed to other appearances of Muſculary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that the Membrane of the Muſcle being drawn away, you ſhall ſeparate ſome fleſhy Fibres from others by cutting the little fibrils, whereby they are joyned, and looſen them quite, you will ſee them ſo ſingular and free, to be wrinkled or drawn together in every motion like the others compacted together.</p>
                     <p>Further, I advertiſe you, that theſe Fibres ſo looſned and freed, ſome cut off in one end, and ſeparated from the Tendon, did yet contract themſelves to the motion of the Muſcle, together with the other Fibres, about the other whole end, without that cut off in the mean time growing flaggy or looſe. After this I divided with a pair of Sciſſers, a certain fleſhy portion of the thinner Muſcle, in three or four pieces tranſverſe, the bigneſs of an inch: which being done, the portions cut off in either end, only entred into, for a ſhort ſpace, ſome light and inordinate corrugations, and preſently became immoveable. The other extreme portions of the Muſcle ſo cut, ſticking to the Tendons, continued to be much more lively and longer contracted, but irregularly and convulſively, to wit, with a certain intortion of the Fibres. Truly, in the Fibres ſo cut off, ſome ſmall footſteps of contraction did remain for a little while, partly by reaſon of the Inſtinct of Motion delivered through the membrana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous fibrils, by which they did yet cohere with the whole fleſh, and partly becauſe the animal Spirits, implanted in the fleſhy Fibres, now divided from the reſt, and left without influence, did exert or put forth their utmoſt contractive endeavours after the uſual manner. For this reaſon ſometimes in the Heart taken out, and in a piece of it cut off with a Sword, as alſo in other Muſcles, after the Nerves and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels are cut off, a contraction and relaxation continue for ſome time. The other Fibres cut off only by reaſon of the acceſs and receſs of the Spirits from the Tendons, were able ſtill in ſome meaſure to be contracted and relaxed.</p>
                     <p>When in the Diaphragma I had freed many ſingular Fibres from the knittings of others, I tryed what Ligatures put in ſeveral places of them might effect. Some of them then being bound about the middle, were contracted even as the whole fibres, but with ſome little ſwelling about the Ligature. When I had bound others about the ends, where they cohere to the Tendons, now one, then another, the motion was chiefly and almoſt only continued about the free end. Further, in the fibres bound at both ends at once, the contraction wholly ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>Contraction and Relaxation are not only ſeen, and indeed probable, in the Heart, but in the Diaphragma and other Muſcles appointed for Reſpiration, which uſe to be performed in all, acting viciſſively, according to the Inſtincts of Nature, and for the moſt part equally (though there are not the like intervals of motions in all) yea, and the Muſcles ſerving to the voluntary function, enter oftentimes into ſpontaneous Contractions, unleſs they be hindred by their Antagoniſts, as it appears, for that the Spaſm or Cramp of one Muſcle comes upon the Palſie of another. Contraction and Relaxation are iterated more ſwiftly in the Heart, than in the Muſcles of Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo perhaps in theſe, than in ſeveral others. In thoſe ready to dye, the fleſhy Pannicle every where trembling, clearly ſhews their changes by innumerable beatings or leapings.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the Humors, whereby all the fibres of a Muſcle, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſhy, tendinous, and membranaceous, and what lies between them, ſeem to be watered, filled, or blown up, we ought to take notice of them, at leaſt two of them, (to wit, the bloody and nervous liquor) if not more. And in the firſt place it is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the ſenſe, that the blood doth waſh all the fleſhy and membranaceous fibres which are interwoven with theſe: becauſe, if the Spirit of Wine, tinctured with Ink, be put into an Artery belonging to any Muſcle, the Vein in the mean time being tyed cloſe, the ſuperficies of all the fleſhy fibres and tranſverſe fibrils are dyed with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Tendons being then ſcarcely at all changed in their colour; it appears from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107014:38"/>hence, that the blood doth every where outwardly water all the fleſh or fleſhy fibres, and only thoſe. We have not yet found by any certain mark, whether the blood enters more deeply the fleſhy fibres, or inſtils into them the ſubtil liquor falling from them, although this laſt ſeems moſt probable; but indeed we affirm, that all the fibres, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſhy, tendinous, and membranaceous, are perpetually and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully actuated by the implanted and inflowing animal Spirits, and conſtantly imbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the nervous liquor, which is the Vehicle of the Spirits. But how far, or how much the aforeſaid humors conduce to the exerciſe of the animal Faculties, doth not eaſily appear; but becauſe the animal Spirits cannot conſiſt without the nervous liquor, and depend very much upon its diſpoſition, we may conclude, that it doth ſerve ſomething to the actuating the motive power; for that reaſon alſo, that the continual afflux of the blood is nevertheleſs neceſſary, an Experiment cited by the Ingenious <hi>Steno,</hi> and proved of late by others, plainly confirms. He hath obſerved, that in a living Dog, the deſcending great Artery being tyed without any previous cutting off, the voluntary motion of all the poſterior parts have ceaſed, as often as he tyed the ſtring, and as often returned again as he looſned the knot.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the chief Phaenomena to be obſerved concerning the frame and action of a Muſcle in the diſſection of Animals, both of ſuch as were living, as alſo of the dead and dying. From which, however placed together and compared among themſelves, how difficult a thing it is to conſtitute the Aetiology of the animal motive faculty, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears even from hence, that the moſt Ingenious <hi>Steno,</hi> after he had very accurately deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Elements of his Myology, by himſelf firſt invented, nevertheleſs he wholly avoided that Hypotheſis which might be founded out of them; for that he yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the explication of a Muſcle by a Rectangle were convenient to Nature in all; wherefore when many run to the manner of muſculary Contraction, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the fibres, and others from their inanition, and ſome to both, he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly profeſſes, that the true cauſes of this thing do not clearly appear to him.</p>
                     <p>And as to this abſtruſe matter, although I do not believe that I am able to bring to light, or ſhew any thing more certainly than others; yet as in mechanical things, when any one would obſerve the motions of a Clock or Engine, he takes the Machine it ſelf to pieces to conſider the ſingular artifice, and doth not doubt but he will learn the cauſes and properties of the Phaenomenon, if not all, at leaſt the chief: In like manner, when it is brought before your eyes to behold and conſider the ſtructure and parts of a Muſcle, the conformations of the moving fibres, their geſts and alterations whilſt they are in motion, why is it that we ſhould deſpair to extricate the means or reaſons of the motive function, either by truths or by what is next to truth? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it may be lawful for me here to bring before you our conceptions and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning this thing, indeed not raſhly taken, or to comply with our former Hypotheſis, or to oppoſe any other; which if they ſhall not ſatisfie all, may at leaſt excite others to find out better.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall here repeat what we have mentioned before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the power or virtue by which a Muſcle is moved, proceeds from the Brain, is conveyed through the Nerves, and is performed by the fleſhy fibres contracted, and by that means abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated. This latter is proved by ocular demonſtration, yea it appears by it, that the motive force doth depend alſo upon thoſe former, and is ſo transferred by a long paſſage, that the influence of the Spirits being ſuppreſſed in their beginning, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the way, for that reaſon the exerciſe of the deſigned motion may be hindred. Further we notifie, that the motive force is far greater in the Muſcle, or in the end, than in the beginning or middle: becauſe the Brain and depending Nerves are made of a tender and fragil ſubſtance, and can pull or draw nothing ſtrongly; but the Muſcle putting forth ſtrongly its contractive force, ſeems almoſt to be equal to the ſtrength of a Poſt or Crow, or of a Pully or Windlace. Sometimes the local motion is a compound Action to be performed of many Organs, which conſiſt in divers places, and as its virtue is far more ſtrong in the end than in the beginning or way, we will inquire by what means, as it were mechanical, the motive force may be ſo augmented or multiplied in its progreſs, then what is brought to the motion from the ſeveral Organs.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, in Artificial things, when for the facilitating of motion, and the increaſing the moving force, many Inſtruments are invented, all of them, or at leaſt the chief, may be reduced to theſe two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, either the ſame force or impreſſion may be continued, without the addition of any new force, from one term
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107014:39"/>or end to the other, or from the firſt mover to the thing moved, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be much increaſed in the way, as the Centers of Gravity are farther off or multiplied; for the farther the motion is begun from the firſt Center of Gravity, the ſtronger it proceeds, as is beheld in a Crow or Leaver, and in other things redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to a Leaver. Then if other things be diſpoſed beyond the firſt Center of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſucceſſively before the end of the motion, as in a circular Wheel, the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force is wont to be increaſed very much. But to this there is required, that the inſtruments of motion be ſufficiently ſtrong and tenacious in their whole tract; for otherwiſe the motive force being increaſed, the ſame breaking falls down before the deſigned action be performed. Secondly, there is another way of multiplying the motive force to a great degree, and alſo at a great diſtance, which is performed with the addition of new forces or of freſh ſupplies, to wit, when the elaſtick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or thoſe making the force, being diſpoſed and ſhut up in private places, as it were little Cells, afterwards, as occaſion ſerves, are ſent forth by a light contact or blaſt of a remote Agent, into the liberty of motion, which they readily perform. By this means, Air compacted and ſhut up, when it is permitted to get out, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly forcing a Bullet or other object, ſends or drives it out a great way. It is ſufficiently known what mighty and often horrid forces Gun-powder yields about the end of the Exploſion, when in the beginning or firſt in kindling, the force being tranſmitted through the fiery fume, as yet weak, might be reſtrained by a light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the hand. There are alſo other exploſive little bodies of a various kind, which being hid in convenient Boxes or Cells, when they are raiſed up into motion by an inkindling, or irritament, or provocative, do often exert an incredible force. It behoves us then to inquire from which of theſe ways it comes to paſs, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force doth in the Muſcles ſo far exceed the force tranſmitted from the Brain through the Nerves, or whether the action of the Muſculary Motion be merely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, or rather elaſtick, or in ſome meaſure exploſive?</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe things it manifeſtly appears, that the Muſcles do draw, to wit, being abbreviated, do bring the Tendon with the hanging part towards it ſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for as much as there is need for the offices of traction to be ſometimes more ſtrongly, ſometimes more weakly performed by them, ſo to have the Centers of Gravity now nigher, now farther off planted from the beginning of the motion; hence the Muſcles which extend or bend the Thigh, eſpecially the <hi>Pſoae</hi> and <hi>Glutaei</hi> (great Muſcles beginning in the Breaſt, and reaching into the Thigh) do hide their fleſhy moving fibres deeply within the Trunk of the Body: but thoſe which turn about the Thigh are conſtituted either near the hole or the riſing of the Bone of the Thigh, or ſomewhere thereabout; in like manner it is obſerved in all the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that the belly of the Muſcle gets a more remote or nearer ſite from the article or hinge of motion, as it deſigned for performing either a ſtronger or weaker motion: But truly this doth not hold as to the other moving parts, to wit, the Brain and Nerves, which cooperate with the Muſcles in the motive Act; becauſe, although the motive force is carried by a long paſſage through all theſe Organs, yet it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a contraction ſo ſtrongly performed by a Muſcle, ſhould be begun by the tender and immoveable Brain, and continued through the ſmall and fragil Nerves, but that it muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed ſome motive Particles are hid in the Muſcle, which, as occaſion is given, are ſtirred up according to the Inſtinct, delivered by the Nerves from the Brain, into motion, as it were with a certain exploſion. But what theſe Particles may be, by what means they are inſtigated into motion, and how they induce the contraction of a Muſcle, ſeems moſt difficult to be unfolded.</p>
                     <p>Truly it may be lawfully concluded from the effect, that elaſtick Particles, and fit to move themſelves, are contained in the Muſcles, and hid every where within the fibres, becauſe the Anatomy of living Creatures diſcovers often a motion in a ſeparated Muſcle, yea in its fibres divided one from another. The Hearts of ſome Animals beat a long while being pulled out of the Body, the Muſcles cut off, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perform the motions of contraction. In great labouring Beaſts ſlain or dying, although the Heart and the Brain be taken out, the fleſhy Pannicle performs for ſome time very many turns of contractions and relaxations. From theſe it is manifeſtly clear, that there are among the Particles of the Muſcles ſome agil and ſelf forcers, or carried by their own force heaped together, which, although the animal oeconomy be very much diſturbed or overthrown, do enter into motion of their own accord, yet in a tranquil eſtate they perform no actions, unleſs commanded by the Brain or Cerebel, and delivered by the Nerves.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:107014:39"/>
                     <p>Whilſt a Muſcle is contracted, the cutting up of a live Creature ſhews only the fleſhy fibres to run into motion by themſelves, to wit, being made more tumid, ſharper, and ſhorter at the ſame time, to amplifie or enlarge the belly of the Muſcle, and in the interim, the Tendons, as if immoveable of themſelves, to wit, not altered either as to their thickneſs or length, only pulled as it were by the fleſhy fibres, to be moved, and to draw with them the moved part; whence it ſeems to be manifeſt, that the animal Spirits or elaſtick Particles, whichſoever they are, whilſt they perform the Muſculary Motion, are only or chiefly agitated among the fleſhy fibres. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hence any one may ſtrongly think, that ſuch Particles are not at all contained, or are wholly idle in the tendinous fibres; for as we have noted, that the Tendon is not changed in the act, we may lawfully ſuſpect, that it is only inſtead of a Crook, by which means the fleſhy fibres being contracted, may draw the member to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at a diſtance from them towards themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But indeed it ſufficiently appears by evident ſigns, that the animal Spirits or elaſtick Particles do lodge within the tendinous fibres, and truly much more plentifully than in the fleſhy: Firſt, the ſenſe ſhews this, to wit, the touch, which is much ſharper and far more ſenſible in the Tendon than in the fleſh: yea any irritation or breach of the unity happening in that part, bring not only a moſt troubleſom ſenſe, to wit, a very cruel pain, but beſides, is wont to excite in the neighbouring fleſh a Tumor or Swelling, and frequently moſt grievous Convulſions; whence we neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the animal Spirits do inhabit the tendinous fibres in great abundance: but what they do there, and by what means they ſerve to the motive function, we will next inquire.</p>
                     <p>As often as the motion of a living Muſcle was beheld by me, I conſidered and weighed in my mind by what means all the fleſhy fibres were contracted and releaſed by turns, I could conceive or collect no other thing than that in every contraction, the Spirits or certain elaſtick Particles did ruſh into the fleſhy fibres from either Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and did intumifie and force them nearer towards themſelves or together; then the ſame Particles preſently coming back from the fleſh into the Tendons, the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Muſcles happened. In a bare or naked Muſcle, when I had ſeparated every fleſhy fibre or a company of them apart from the reſt in the whole paſſage by help of a Microſcope, I moſt plainly perceived the Tumor, begun at either end of the fleſh, to be carried towards the middle, as it were by the Spirits, entred here and there at once. Further (which I mentioned before) each fibre being tyed about the middle, being as it were as yet free and compacted with the others, was contracted or drawn together; but a Ligature being put to both ends, it remained flaggy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly above or beyond the bound place. But that I might no longer doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I applied two Ligatures, at equal diſtances from the middle and the ends, about the ſame bundle of fleſhy fibres, which being done, a contraction and ſwelling up ariſing preſently from either fleſhy extreme to the places bound, went no farther; the middle part between in the mean time being unmoved, remained flaccid; whence it may be well concluded, that in every muſculary contraction the animal Spirits or elaſtick Particles do leap out from the tendinous fibres into the fleſhy, and viciſſively in the relaxation, recede or run back from theſe into thoſe.</p>
                     <p>However this being proved and granted, there yet remain very many difficulties concerning Muſculary Motion; for firſt, it may be asked how the animal Spirits, which enter ſilently, or without any incitation, or Tumor, the tendinous fibres do ſo blow up the fleſhy fibres, that they are able to force them altogether into ſhorter ſpaces.</p>
                     <p>For the producing this effect, plenty of Spirits leaping from the tendinous fibres, do not ſeem alone ſufficient; but beſides, we may ſuppoſe ſome other kind of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, implanted in the fleſhy fibres, meeting with the others flowing from the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, do forthwith ſtrive, whence a mutual rarefaction, and turgeſcency or ſwelling up of them, or an inflation or ſudden blowing up of the containing bodies, together with an abbreviation or ſhortning of them, doth ariſe; not much unlike, as when the Corpuſcles or little bodies of fire entring into a piece of leather, or any thing, and forcing variouſly here and there its implanted Particles (whereby they are preſently inſnared) make it ſo to be ſtuffed and wrinkled; in like manner alſo the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, although they paſs through the Tendons, where they are ſolitary or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without moving them (as the Effluvia's of heat in Metals or more dry bodies) yet being dilated in the fleſh, for that there joyning with elaſtick Particles of another
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107014:40"/>kind, they are expanded or ſtretched out, they cauſe the ſudden inflations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugations of the containing fibres. But we have elſewhere ſhewn, that ſuch Particles divers and wholly heterogene to the nature of the Spirits, may be copiouſly and eaſily carried to the Muſcles. For indeed it is plain by ocular demonſtration, that the blood doth every where waſh and water outwardly all the fleſhy fibres, which beſides, it is thought not only to nouriſh, but alſo to be buſied about the offices of the animal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and what can be leſs ſuſpected, than that it doth inſtil into their Pipes a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſubtil liquor, whoſe Particles being agitated, and alſo rarified by the Spirits flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, ſtuff up the fibres, (as we but now hinted) and compel them intumified, by reaſon of the aſſault on either ſide made, into ſhorter ſpaces?</p>
                     <p>But that the fleſhy belly of the Muſcle, whilſt it is contracted, doth ſwell up, is not at all to be doubted, becauſe this is evidently beheld by the ſight and touch in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of living Creatures: to wit, all the fleſhy fibres being wrinkled together, are made more tumid and ſharper, and ſo ſhorten the Muſcle, and make it alſo thicker and broader: For the more certain belief of this, when I had bound ſome of the fleſhy fibres, ſeparated from the knitting of the reſt, and had left others near them looſe, there appeared a notable difference between thoſe flaccid or not ſwelled, and theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumified or ſwelled up in every contraction of the Muſcle.</p>
                     <p>But if it be demanded, of what nature, to wit, whether ſpirituous ſaline, as may be believed, or of any other diſpoſition, the animal Spirits, derived from the Brain into the Muſcles, may be; and then whether the other Latex, immediately carried to them from the blood, is ſulphureous or nitrous. Concerning theſe, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to the ſenſe, we ſhall pronounce nothing raſhly or poſitively. But even as in other natural things, the active Particles of a various kind, which being unlike among themſelves, are found apt mutually to grow hot, or to be ſtruck off from one another, or otherwiſe to be rarified or expanded; and as the inteſtine motions of Bodies, and eſpecially the elaſtick, ſuch as are the contractions of the Muſcles, can only proceed from the congreſſions of ſuch like, certainly it may be lawful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that theſe do wholly depend upon ſuch a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as to the Muſculary Motion in general, we ſhall conclude after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a ſufficiently probable conjecture, <hi>viz.</hi> that the animal Spirits being brought from the Head by the paſſage of the Nerves to every Muſcle, and (as it is very likely) received from the membranaceous fibrils, are carried by their paſſage into the tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fibres, and there they are plentifully laid up as in fit Store-houſes; which Spirits, as they are naturally nimble and elaſtick, where ever they may, and are permitted, expanding themſelves, leap into the fleſhy fibers; then the force being finiſhed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſinking down, they ſlide back into the Tendons, and ſo viciſſively. But whilſt the ſame animal Spirits, at the inſtinct given for the performing of motion, do leap out of the tendinous fibers into the fleſhy, they meet there with active Particles of another nature, ſupplied from the blood, and preſently they grow mutually hot; ſo that by the ſtrife and agitation of both, the fleſhy fibres, for that they are lax and porous, are ſtuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and driven into wrinklings, from all which being at once wrinkled or ſhrivell'd up, the contraction of the whole Muſcle proceeds; the contraction being finiſhed, the ſincere or clear Spirits, which reſide or are aſſwaged, go back for the moſt part into the tendinous fibres, the other Particles being left within the fleſh; the loſs or waſting of theſe the blood ſupplies, as the Nerves do thoſe. By what inſtinct the muſculary contraction begins and ends, ſhall be inquired into preſently.</p>
                     <p>That the animal Spirits, flowing from the tendinous Fibres, may enter equally all the fleſhy, there are two Tendons in every ſimple Muſcle, which are ſo conſtituted, according to oppoſite Angles, that the Spirits running to them from a twofold ſtarting place or bound, might preſently fill the whole belly of the Muſcle, and that motion being finiſhed, might immediately ſwiftly retire. If the contraction ought to be performed indifferently towards the middle of the fleſh, the Tendons for the moſt part are equal; but if the motion inclines more towards one region of the fleſh, one Tendon (to wit, which may ſupply a greater company of Spirits) exceeds the other in magnitude. If the Muſcle, whereby it may be the ſtronger, is big and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an ample bulk or ſubſtance, it is divided as it were into many Lobes or Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and two Tendons are ordained to each of them; to wit, to the end that the animal Spirits might be carried through ſhort paſſages from the Tendons into the fleſhy fibres, and might leap back again: becauſe the compounded Muſcle doth not always contain more ſeries of moving fibres, that it might perform many and divers motions,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107014:40"/>but that it might make the ſame motion often with the greater ſtrength. For, as we hinted before, as a ſimple Muſcle was as a ſingle leaver or bar, the compound ſeems as if it were many leavers or bars ſerving for the removing the ſame body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly.</p>
                     <p>Further, hence we may obſerve in ſome Muſcles, which are ſimple and regular, that all the fleſhy fibres are equal, and ſo all the tendinous of one extreme being put together, are equal to all of the other end being put together; yet they ſingle, where they are ſhorter in one Tendon, are longer in the other, and ſo diſpoſed, that the tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fibres on either part, the top and bottom, have their exceſſes inverſe, and at once equal; to wit, that here a long is laid upon a ſhort, or the longeſt upon the ſhorteſt, and there quite contrary, the ſhorteſt upon the longeſt, to the end, that the motion might be ſo made every where in this or that ſide of the Muſcle, or at the end more ſtrong, more plentiful Spirits flow together into thoſe parts from the longer ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous fibres, and on the contrary: wherefore in ſome Muſcles leſs neceſſary, where the part of the fleſh growing to the bone, either becomes immoveable, or only ſerves for the filling up of empty ſpaces, one Tendon is ſhorter or leſſer, and oftentimes degenerates into a bony or cartilaginous hardneſs. Further it is obſerved, as to other ſtrong and greatly moving Muſcles, that their Tendons are not ſo diſpoſed, as if they were only ſtays, props, handles, or hanging crooks of the fleſhy fibres; for ſo they are only conſtituted in their extreme ends; yet the tendinous fibres, that they may be made more apt promptuaries of the animal Spirits, being ſtretched out almoſt into all parts of the Muſcle, receive every where both ends of the fleſhy; which indeed yet more manifeſtly appears in the compound Muſcles, for that one Tendon being compounded, embraces the extreme fleſh, and the other enters into the middle of the fleſh, as hath been already ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>But truly the animal Spirits, whilſt they leap out of the tendinous into the fleſhy fibres, are not ſufficient of themſelves for the wrinkling of them, but require another elaſtick Copula from the blood; this may be argued from many reaſons. Firſt, it ſeems to appear from this, that the ſame Spirits being ſolitary or by themſelves, though moſt thickly planted within the Tendons, ſtir up no Tumor or Contraction whilſt they are moved in them; wherefore being dilated within the fleſhy fibres in a leſſer quantity, and having got a larger ſpace, they would be ſtretched out, unleſs they met or ſtrove with other Particles, much leſs would they obtain a contractive force. Beſides, when any wound or grievous trouble happens to a Tendon, the belly of the Muſcle or fleſhy part is chiefly troubled with a Tumor or Spaſm; for the Spirits being irritated, not ſo much within themſelves, but where they are violently driven among heterogene Particles, ſtir up the greateſt tumults and inordinations. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the fleſhy fibres are watered with the ſanguineous humor beyond other parts, and more than may ſuffice for their nouriſhment, for what other uſe ſhould it be aſſigned, unleſs that it may contribute to the motive function? Eſpecially we take notice in lean Bodies, which are more ſparingly nouriſhed, that the Muſcles being fuſed or drenched with more plentiful blood, do perform the ſtrongeſt endeavours of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: moreover, it doth not appear by what way beſides, the expence of the Spirits in a Muſcle, conſumed with continual hard motions or labours, ſhould be made up or renewed, unleſs, beſides the ſmall ſupplements by the Nerves, others ſufficiently plentiful ſhould be ſupplied from the bloody maſs. Add to theſe, that members deſtitute of the wonted afflux of blood, eaſily fall into weakneſs or a Palſie; and that from the obſervation of Doctor <hi>Steno,</hi> in a live Dog the trunk of the deſcending Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery being tyed, all the lower or poſterior members were ſuddenly deprived of motion. And though it doth not yet appear plainly to me, whether the excluſion of the blood from the ſpinal Marrow, or from the Muſcles themſelves, or from both together, be the cauſe; yet however it comes almoſt to the ſame thing, for as much as the animal Spirits being procreated within the Head, and ſtretched out by the medullary and nervous Appendices into every member, without the concourſe of the blood, they ſhould not be able to perform the loco-motive power.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far explained by what means a Muſcle being contracted in the fleſhy part, as to all the fibres at once, performs the motive function; we ſhall next inquire, what is the reaſon of the Inſtinct whereby every motion, both regular and irregular, is wont to be obeyed or is performed. Concerning this in general, it firſt appears, that the motions of every regular motion, yea and the impulſes of ſome irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being conceived within the Brain or Cerebel, are tranſmitted from thence by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107014:41"/>the Nerves to every Muſcle. This (as we have elſewhere ſhewn) is moſt evidently declared by the effects and conſequences: yet here great difficulties remain, to wit, how by the ſame paſſages freſh forces of animal Spirits are conveyed from the Head to every Muſcle, and at the ſame time the old ones exerciſing the Empire of the Soul; beſides, with what difference and divers carriage of the inflowing Spirits, the Nerves perform either of theſe tasks, or both theſe offices.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe, as I conjecture, it ſeems that the animal Spirits, which flowing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from the Head to refreſh the forces of the implanted Spirits, are carried to the Muſcle by the Nerves, do move to it quietly and eaſily, and being there preſently received by the membranceous Fibres, they go apart into the Tendons: which kind of relief, although it ſhould be but little in bulk, yet becauſe it is carried night and day by a conſtant courſe, it eaſily ariſes to a ſufficient proviſion for the continual fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up of the Tendons. But that we ſuppoſe, the Spirits ſo brought perpetually to the Muſcle to be transferred by the membranaceous Fibres, and not by the fleſhy, to the Tendons, the reaſon is, becauſe if they ſhould firſt enter into theſe, ſtraight run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into an elaſtick Copula, they would ſtir up the Muſcle into continual motions: more over, for that in the Heart and Muſcles of Reſpiration the fleſhy Fibres are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with a perpetual motion, they wait not for the paſſage of freſh Spirits to the Tendons.</p>
                     <p>But as to what reſpects the Inſtincts delivered through the Nerves from the Head for the performing, or ſtaying, or any ways altering of the muſculary motion, of theſe we ought firſt to conſider, that the moving animal Spirits, whoſe companies or throngs conſtitute the Hypoſtaſis of the bodily Soul, have theſe two properties as it were implanted in their nature; to wit, that whilſt they are lively, numerous, and free, they exert or expand themſelves, then that force being finiſhed, they being a little diminiſhed, retire themſelves and grow quiet; but afterwards being refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they leap out again, and ſo viciſſively. Waking and ſleep, and the alterations of work and idleneſs or reſt, inbred in all living Creatures, ſufficiently declare this. Wherefore to the impulſe or inſtincts of ſome Muſcles, (which are wont to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually contracted and releaſed) ſcarce any thing more is required, but that their Tendons may be ſupplied by the Nerves with a conſtant influx of animal Spirits; but the Spirits themſelves, becauſe they are numerous and expeditious of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do willingly leap out into the moving Fibres, then the charge being performed, after a ſmall loſs or expence, they immediately withdraw, and being again preſently recruited, they are again expanded, and ſo viciſſively. Further, their actions (which chiefly are Pulſe and Breathing) are variouſly changed according to the degrees of heat or of the affections, for as much as the Spirits being brought by the Nerves, are ſent from the Cerebel, ſometimes more remiſly, ſometimes more plentifully, or more nimbly.</p>
                     <p>Further, in ſome other Muſcles ſubject to the Empire of the Appetite, as the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits naturally affect turns of expanſion and receſs, there is only need of a ſign to be given, either for the performing or ſtopping of the commanded motion; either of which, the inflowing Spirits by their various knocking againſt the Muſcle, eaſily perform, in ordering the implanted Spirits into various aſpects or tendencies. When the Muſcle is contracted, the implanted Spirits, whilſt they are looſned from either end towards the middle, look and tend with a changed front from the middle towards either end. And ſo, whilſt the inflowing Spirits carry the Symbol of performing Contraction, they being incited by heaps within the Nerve, more fully blow up its end, inſerted to the Muſcle, (where they are more thickly crowded together) and ſo cauſe it there to be contracted and abbreviated; whereby it comes to paſs, that the ſame inflowing Spirits, about to enter into the Muſcle, are at that time ſtopped by a mere heap, or rather are called back towards the intumified Nerve; wherefore by and by the whole ſeries of the implanted Spirits (hence their inclination being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) alſo looks that way, and ſo the inhabitants of the Tendons, leaping out from their little Cells into the fleſhy Fibres, cauſe motive contraction: then the motion is broken off or ceaſes aſſoon as the Spirits being before called back towards the Nerve, do tend again into the Muſcle, and ſo the front of the Army being again changed, bands of the implanted Spirits are preſently compelled into the Tendons. That the thing is in a manner thus, I am perſwaded, not out of a mere agreeableneſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnity of our Hypotheſis, but from Anatomical obſervation. Becauſe once diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Whelp alive, when by chance I beheld ſome Muſcles of the hinder part of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107014:41"/>Head and Neck divided and ſeparated at the ſame inſtant, wherein the fleſhy Fibres, as alſo the Nerves inſerted into them, were ſeen at once to be contracted, and being intumified, to be abbreviated.</p>
                     <p>For the promoting the receſs of the Spirits out of the fleſhy Fibres into the Tendons, whilſt the Muſcle is contracted, the membranaceous Fibrils, which every where cut croſs-wiſe the flefly, and thickly ſtick between, ſeem to help. The texture of theſe never to be enough admired, is better perceived in a Muſcle endued with large Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, <hi>viz.</hi> an Oxes being boiled to a tenderneſs. For in ſuch a one, if gently opening the fleſhy Fibres, you ſhall draw them one from another through the whole ſeries, you ſhall ſee little Fibrils, like hairs, moſt thickly extended upon every one of thoſe Tubes, which little Fibrils, not only cloſe and knit together the fleſhy Fibres, but alſo lying upon every one of their ſeries, and cutting them in oblique Angles, they alſo are all carried parallel, from Tendon to Tendon, in an oppoſite ſite to the fleſhy: therefore whilſt the Muſcle being contracted, the fleſhy Fibres do ſwell up, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brils embracing them, that they may give place, are ſomewhat diſtended; then as ſoon as the ſwelling up remits, theſe returning to their wonted ſtraitneſs, preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether every where the fleſh, and the Spirits being expulſed on either ſide, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to their priſtine length. It makes for this, that whilſt the Muſcle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the Spirits inflowing through the Nerves, depart from their membranaceous Fibrils; wherefore theſe being empty and lax, are able more eaſily to be diſtended; but whilſt the Muſcle is relaxed, the Spirits again entring the Fibrils, fill them, and that they may the better bind the fleſhy Fibres, they make them ſhorter.</p>
                     <p>The Inſtincts of Motions, to be obeyed by the Muſcles, ſo delivered by the Nerves, are, being ſent either from the Brain, performed at the command, and with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Appetite; or from the Cerebel, according to the Laws of Nature, for the moſt part unknown to us. But beſides, ſometimes the Muſcles are carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or contrary to the pleaſure of the Appetite or Nature, into irregular motions, <hi>viz.</hi> violent and convulſive, and that happens after various manners and for divers cauſes. Concerning theſe, ſome time ſince diſcourſing more largely, we have ſhewn, that from thence do ariſe many kinds and differences of convulſive motions; as the Spaſmodick matter being ſomewhere fixed, doth ſubſiſt either about the beginnings, middle, or ends of the Nerves; or becauſe the ſame thing being wandring and looſe, runs about here and there through the whole paſſages of the Nerves, and ſo variouſly transfers from place to place convulſive diſtempers. But beſides theſe divers kinds of Convulſions, which are excited by reaſon of ſome evil or vice ſticking ſomewhere to the Nerves themſelves, this our Myology or Doctrine of the Muſcles, hath diſcovered ſome Convulſions of another kind ariſing from the Muſcles being chiefly affected.</p>
                     <p>For indeed we muſt advertiſe you, that the animal Spirits, diſpoſed among the Muſcles themſelves, by reaſon of a taint or evil derived from the Brain, or from the Blood, or perhaps oftentimes from both together, are infected with certain hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene Particles, by reaſon of which they cannot reſt or lye quiet in their Cells; but being always unquiet and reſtleſs, leap out of their own accord from the tendinous Fibres into the fleſhy, and ſo oftentimes produce frequent and cruel Convulſions. But this we have obſerved to be done after a twofold manner, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, for that the Spirits being burdened with an elaſtick Copula, remain not long within the Tendons, but leaping out. from thence into the fleſhy Fibres, induce frequent Convulſions of a Muſcle, but ſhort, and as it were by leaps; or ſecondly, becauſe the animal Spirits, although they ſometimes lye quietly within the Tendons, yet being inordinately ſnatched into the fleſh, and there cruelly exploded, they cannot be preſently repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, brought into order, or reduced into the Tendons, but whether we will or not, they perſiſt a long while expanded, and ſo bring forth a long and very painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Muſcle. Which kind of Spaſm, ſufficiently known, we vulgarly term the Cramp.</p>
                     <p>The former diſtemper (called the Convulſive Leaping) is familiar both to malignant Feavers, and to the Scurvy. As to thoſe, we have ordinarily known, when either no Criſis, or an evil one is obtained, that heterogene Particles from the blood and nervous juyce very much vitiated, are not only laid up in the Bowels, (whoſe diſpoſitions and functions they pervert) but almoſt every where in the Muſcles; and there growing to the Spirits, do affect them with a certain madneſs, ſo as they cannot continue peaceably together, or reſt within the Tendons, but being divided and diſtracted one from another, leap out from thence by bands into the fleſh, and there ſtir up the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107014:42"/>leſſer and moſt frequent Spaſms or Convulſions. In like manner, by reaſon of the Spirits inhabiting the Muſcles, being burdened with an elaſtick Copula there growing to them, ſome labouring with an inveterate Scurvy, cannot contain their limbs in the ſame ſite or poſition, but are neceſſitated ſometimes to extend the hands or feet, ſometimes to fling them about here and there, to transfer them variouſly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſubdue their madneſs by running, leaping, or other hard labours.</p>
                     <p>Treating ſome time ſince of Convulſive Motions, we did almoſt wholly omit the Aetiology of the continuing Spaſm or Tetaniſm, as a thing which depended upon the Doctrine of the Muſcles, to be treated of afterwards: Then we only hinted, that the contraction of that kind did ariſe in one Muſcle, becauſe its other Antagoniſt was reſolved or looſned, which indeed oftentimes happens in the face and ſome members; in which, whilſt the parts upon one ſide are troubled with the Palſie, thoſe oppoſite on the other, as it were looſned in the Reins, are too much contracted. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this kind of Spaſm for the moſt part is without pain; beſides, this is not eaſily or preſently paſſed over or cured no more than the Palſie, which is the cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as to what belongs to the formal reaſon of the Spaſm, called in our Idiom the Cramp; every one labouring with this diſtemper, perceives in himſelf one or more Muſcles to be moſt ſtrongly and involuntarily drawn together, and they being for ſome time ſo highly diſtended, remain as it were ſtiff; and in the mean time, for that the fleſhy Fibres being cruelly contracted, do violently haul or pull either Tendon, to wit, that which is fixed to the immoveable part, perhaps no leſs than the other part to be moved, they cauſe a moſt troubleſom pain. But ſometimes this Spaſm being excited, by reaſon of the animal Spirits carrying themſelves out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly into the fleſhy Fibres, doth not ceaſe until the ſame Spirits being returned into the Tendons, ſuffer the fleſh to be relaxed; therefore its neareſt cauſes will be both the greater impetuoſity of the animal Spirits among the fleſhy Fibres, with which they leap thither unbid; and alſo their long continuance or ſtay, for that they return back more ſlowly and difficultly into the Tendons. For the ſecondary cauſes may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, both the evil diſpoſition of the animal Spirits, and alſo the evil conformation of the Tendons, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes this, ſometimes that, and not ſeldom both together.</p>
                     <p>As to the former; this diſtemper, as other Convulſions, ſeems to ariſe, for as much as the animal Spirits, being burdened with heterogeneous Particles or an elaſtick Copula, at length being irritated, they are incited to the ſtriking of it off: which notwithſtanding, being thick and viſcous, and for that cauſe more tenacious, is not ſoon nor eaſily ſhaken off, but that the Spirits being ſtill provoked by the ſame, and ſhut up within the fleſhy Fibres, are longer detained in the expanſion: which thing perhaps happens not ſo much unlike, as when water and air being joyned together, make a bubble; which, if it be made of water, wherein a little Sope is put, is more tenacious, much more large, and continues longer than that made only of mere wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So we obſerve, that they who abound in thick and tartareous humours, are moſt obnoxious to theſe kind of Cramps, and beſides, that they who preſently ſleep upon drinking or eating groſs meats, after full eating, and eſpecially after a large and plentiful ſupper, do ſuffer moſt cruel aſſaults of this diſeaſe; but ſometimes the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons themſelves are found to be in the fault, for that they being too hard bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or obſtructed, they do not eaſily admit the Spirits returning from the fleſhy Fibres. The obſtruction of the Tendons is the cauſe, that Gouty and Scorbutick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Tendons ſalt and tartareous humours eaſily run into and obſtruct, are wont to be cruelly tormented with theſe kind of painful Cramps: But that the conſtriction of the Tendons doth ſometimes bring forth this diſeaſe, appears by this, for that ſome Women with Child, (as I have been often told) about the latter end of their Time, by reaſon of the Muſcles of the Abdomen being too much extended, are wont to be troubled with frequent Cramps, only in the bottom of their Bellies. For the illuſtrating of this Pathology we will add this following Caſe.</p>
                     <p>A Noble Woman, young and fair, ſome time ſince obnoxious to Hyſterick diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and now above two years ago to Convulſive, and in a manner Epileptical; of late, by reaſon of the frequent and moſt cruel aſſaults of the diſeaſe, ſhe became alſo Cachectical and Paralytical, that at length her Abdomen was diſtempered with an Aſcites, and her Legs with a wateriſh Tumor, and laſtly, all her lower parts, below her Hips, were deprived of motion; hence, as often as the Convulſive fits infeſted her, ſhe was wont, not now to move her body or members here and there, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107014:42"/>theſe, ſometimes thoſe parts being ſnatched with the Tetaniſm, were variouſly bent and twiſted about, that in the mean time, ſhe her ſelf ſitting in her Bed or Chair, remained ſtiff and almoſt immoveable. It is not long ſince, that ſeeing the whole manner of one of theſe Fits, I obſerved, not without great admiration, divers ſorts of turns and changes of alterations of the Spaſms. At the firſt aſſault, her eyes being turned about ſwiftly hither and thither, ſhe was preſently taken with inſenſibility, then by and by her head being turned and contracted of one ſide, preſently her arms and legs at once became ſtiff, and all her Joynts, ſometimes of one ſide, ſometimes of both, were bowed or ſtretched out: perhaps after four or five minutes theſe Spaſms both in her Head and Limbs remitting, of a ſudden others, for the moſt part oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, followed; which being often finiſhed in the like ſpace, others far different did ariſe, and ſo for two or three hours, longer Spaſms almoſt of every kind and faſhion, being excited through her whole Body, followed upon one another; ſo that her head being convulſed or pulled by turns from the right to the left, and contracted before and behind, yea and all her Limbs being bent inwardly here and there, or diſtended outwardly in the Courſe of one Fit, ſhe exhibited all ſorts of Convulſive geſtures. When at any time the Spaſms of one ſort continued longer in the Head or Limbs than uſual, it was the cuſtom of the Servants about her to blow up ſtrongly into her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils the Fume of Tabaco; which being done, as the Spirits recovered within, the preſent Spaſms immediately remitted, but upon them others of a new kind ſucceeded. Of late the Legs of this Lady were ſo debilitated by being looſned, that ſhe could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go nor ſtand, yea her Tendons under either Ham, being made tumid and ſhorter, were ſo contracted, that ſhe could not ſtretch out her Legs ſtraight.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the caſe of this ſick Noble Lady, it may be demanded, wherefore upon the firſt coming of the Fit, no throwing about of the Body or Limbs, as is wont in moſt Convulſive or Epileptical people, but only continued Spaſms or Convulſions variouſly tranſlated from one part to another, and ſo others, did ariſe? For the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, we ſay, that the Spaſmodick matter is not only heaped up in the Brain and Nerves, but alſo in the Muſcles themſelves, and grows to the Spirits inhabiting the Tendons: And as that matter is tenacious, and the Spirits weak, and unable for the ſtriking off quickly or eaſily ſuch a Copula; therefore as often as theſe being irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, do leap out of the Tendons into the fleſh, the Muſcles being firſt poſſeſt, they cauſe ſtrong and long Contractions; in the mean time, other Muſcles, eſpecially their Antagoniſts or oppoſites, being hindred and bound up from motion, until the Convulſions of the former are remitted; hence the Members, however convulſed, are not moved out of their place, becauſe the moving or carrying of the Body, or any Members, is not performed but by the help or duty of many Muſcles, whilſt ſome of them either rightly cooperate with others, or at leaſt obey them, to wit, ſo that ſome reſpective Muſcles, obſerving due cooperation, are contracted at once, then thoſe being looſned, the contraction of others immediately ſucceeds. But if they which are unequal and unlike, are at once contracted and ſtrongly convulſed, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, ſo that other Muſcles in the mean time cannot be contracted, there will be a neceſſity for the members bent or extended here and there, to remain as they are wholly ſtiff. But that the preſent Convulſions were always remitted by the blowing the ſmoke of Tabaco up her Noſe, the reaſon is, becauſe the region or ſome part of the bodily Soul being vehemently affected, if by chance a new paſſion equally violent be brought upon another part, the firſt is preſently aboliſhed or ceaſes: For in truth, it appears by conſtant obſervation, where-ever the greater or freſher trouble is, that thither greater plenty of Spirits preſently flock and make a tumult: wherefore any new irritation being excited in the Brain or its Meninges, whatſoever others were begun outwardly among the Muſcles, immediately vaniſh or are obſcured; then as ſoon as this freſh trouble is paſſed over, Convulſions outwardly ariſe forthwith again, but in other parts where more heaps of Spaſmodick matter lye not yet conſumed. But that long continued Spaſms do ariſe, either by reaſon of the Spirits being burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a more tenacious Copula, or by reaſon of the Tendons being obſtructed with a viſcous or tartareous matter from either or both, it appears from hence, becauſe this diſeaſe increaſing (as in the caſe of this Noble Lady) the Tendons are at length ſo ſhortned by the more plentiful heaping up of the morbifick matter, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtiff and ſhorter, and for that reaſon they hardly or not at all grant any place to the Spirits for the conſtant performing of the motive function.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Muſculary Motion, both natural and convulſive, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107014:43"/>of both, which we have proved with what diligence we were able, and by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Experiments: But if any one ſhall object, that they are not very firm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have noted in the cutting up of live Creatures, that the Heart and Muſcles of Reſpiration and the fleſhy Pannicle, after that the Nerves and Arteries are cut away, do continue for ſome time their turns of Contraction and Relaxation, whence it is argued, againſt our Hypotheſis, that their motions do not depend upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant influx of the blood and animal Spirits; it will be plain to return this Anſwer, That in thoſe about to dye, it ſometimes happens ſo, becauſe the Soul being then diſtracted and drawing near to diſſolution, all the implanted Spirits at once being cut off from the commerce of thoſe influencing or flowing in, do of their own accord exert themſelves, and perform (as long as they are able) their wonted motions; which being continued for a little ſpace only, need not the ſubſidy or aſſiſtance of freſh forces, becauſe the veterane, till they are quite worn out, perform their wonted tasks; yea alſo the old ſanguineous Copula, till it be wholly conſumed, receives and lets go their embraces with a conſtant change: But this more rarely ſucceeds in other Muſcles ſubject to the Empire of the Appetite, and wont only to be exerciſed as occaſion ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as we have affirmed, that the Inſtinct for the performing of Motions is brought altogether through the Nerves from the Head to the Muſcle, and as every Trunk of the ſame Nerve, being oftentimes broken into many ſhoots, variouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing them, ſends it to many deſtinated Muſcles, it may very well be doubted, how the animal Spirits, conveying the Symbol of the motion to be performed with a certain choice, do actuate only theſe or thoſe branches apart from other branches of the ſame, and do not indifferently enter all the branches or ſhoots of the ſame; to wit, as the blood paſſes through the Trunk of the Artery, and all its ramifications equally. The moſt Learned <hi>Regius,</hi> that he might ſolve this knot, ſuppoſes in the Nerves ſome little doors, like to thoſe which are found in muſical Organs, the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whereof admit the Spirits to theſe or thoſe parts eſpecially, the reſt being ſhut up. But he ought to have ſhewn, if not the little doors themſelves, yet at leaſt by what inſtinct and by whoſe direction ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe are locked up, and others opened. But in truth, this may rather be ſaid, that all the ſhoots of the Nerves and leſſer branches remain diſtinct and ſingular among themſelves from the parts to which they are inſerted, even to their beginnings; ſo that a peculiar tract of the Spirits or way of paſſage lyes open, from the Brain and its medullary Appendix, to every Muſcle and nervous part; for in truth, although the Nerves, according to their beginnings, may ſeem to ariſe from the greater Trunks; yet it will eaſily appear, if you ſhall open the trunk and thoſe branches, that in them many little Nerves, only like hairs, for the ſake of a better conduct, are collected together in the ſame bundle; yea, the coverings being ſeparated, you may follow oftentimes the little Nervulets, and thoſe ſingle to the reſpective parts and members, to which they are deſtinated.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, although there be ſingular paſſages or chanels of the animal Spirits of moſt Nerves, diſtinct among themſelves; yet ſome do variouſly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with others through the branches and ſhoots ſent on either ſide; which indeed ought to be ſo made, that when many Nerves together, are required to ſome motion of a Muſcle equally, all theſe, by reaſon of the commerce mutually had between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might conſpire in the ſame action; hence, in ſome motions of the members, as in the ſtriking of a Harp or Lute and other complicated actions, many Muſcles co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with admirable celerity; ſo that, although many be imployed at once, they perform their task ſeverally without any confuſion. Beſides, there is need for the Nerves to communicate mutually among themſelves, becauſe of the Sympathetical motions of the members and of ſome of the parts, for neither for any other cauſe is the Nerve of the Diaphragma inſerted into the brachial branches, or thoſe belonging to the Arms, than that the exerciſe of living Creatures, eſpecially in running or fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, might be proportionate to the tenour of Reſpiration. Hence it alſo proceeds, that in any paſſion, the Praecordia being bound up or dilated, the countenance and aſpect of the face, yea and the geſtures of the hands and members are pathetically figured. We have propoſed ſufficient Inſtances of this ſort in our particular Hiſtory of the Nerves, ſo that we need not here add any thing more.</p>
                     <p>What remains for the illuſtrating our Myology or Tract of the Muſcles, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to have added, <hi>viz.</hi> four Figures, which may repreſent to the life both the exteriour and interiour true and natural faces or appearances both of a ſimple and compounded Muſcle.</p>

                  <p>ONCE more your <hi>Sidley</hi> Profeſſor and your Servant (the more happy Title) flings himſelf at Your feet, with this only Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he might render ſomething of Thanks for Your Kindneſs and benefits, and that our Labours might chuſe ſuch a Patron, that might give Credit to the Author. But I fear, leſt by my repeated Duty I may ſeem troubleſom, and no leſs in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Your Benefits, than others in ſuing for them: But ſo great is my Gratitude, and ſo exceeding is Your good Nature, that they cannot be crowded into a little compaſs, much leſs wearied out or drawn dry.</p>
                  <p>But there is another Reaſon, which if it doth not command what I do, may at leaſt excuſe and defend it. For when I had reſolved to unlock the ſecret places of Mans Mind, and to look into the living and breathing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Deity (as far as our weakneſs was able) I thought it not lawful to make uſe of the Favours and Patronage of a leſs Perſon, neither perhaps would it have become me. For You indeed are He, who moſt happily preſides (both by Merit and Authority) over all our Temples and Sacred Things. Therefore after I had ſlain ſo many Victims, whole Hecatombs almoſt of all Animals, in the Anatomical Court, I could not have thought them rightly offered, unleſs they had been brought to the moſt holy Altar of Your Grace.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, how great the labour is that I undertake: For it hath been a long while accounted as a certain Myſtery and School-houſe of Atheiſm to ſearch into Nature, as if whatever Reaſons we grant to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, ſhould derogate from Religion, and all that ſhould be attributed to ſecond Cauſes, did take away from the firſt.</p>
                  <p>But truly, he doth too much abuſe the Name of Philoſophy, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the wheels, curious frame, ſetting together, ſmall pins, and all the make and proviſion of a Clock, by which invented Machine the courſe of the Time, the orders of the Months, the changes of the Planets, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ebbing of the Sea, and other things of that kind, may be exactly known and meaſured, if that at length, when by this his ſearch and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb facs="tcp:107014:46"/>he hath profited himſelf ſo much, he ſhould not acknowledge the Artiſt, to whoſe Labour and Wit he owes all thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure I am of another mind and opinion, who look into the Pandects of Nature, as into another Table of the Divine Word, and the greater Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For indeed, in either Volume there is no high point, which requires not the care, or refuſes the induſtry of an Interpreter; there is no Page certainly which ſhews not the Author, and his Power, Goodneſs, Truſt, and Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, there is no right Weigher of things that can lay to our charge as a fault, that we have ſtudied theſe Rolls of Nature, becauſe ſome Atheiſts may be made thereby; which may be objected to the ſtudies of Divines in Sacred Letters, that from their proviſion Hereticks have taken their Arguments and Opinions, and turned them againſt them and Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>That I may deal freely, whoever profeſſes Philoſophy, and doth not think rightly of God, I do judge him not only to have ſhaken hands with Religion, but alſo with Reaſon, and that he hath at once put off Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy as well as Chriſtianity. Therefore I deſire, that all mine may be tryed and approved, no leſs by the demonſtration of Piety and Canons of the Church, than by the Rule of Experience and Knowledge, to which I keep: Neither do I intreat and reſpect only the <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of humane Arts, but alſo the Primate and chief of Divine, whilſt I openly profeſs my ſelf, with all due obſervance,</p>

                  <p>THE Romans ſometimes promiſed to themſelves an Empire, an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the happy Augury of an humane Head being turned out of the Glebe; neither could they perſwade themſelves, that the Capitol ſhould be the Head of the World, unleſs it had been built upon the Skull of a Man. I do not think of Empires in Arts, nor do I promiſe to my ſelf Triumphs by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the World of Letters: But in the mean time, I had wholly fruſtrated thoſe Illuſtrious Documents I had long ſince learned, unleſs with thoſe Auſpices I had laboured in Philoſophy, eſpecially the Natural.</p>
                  <p>For the Province, which I hold in this Academy, requiring that I ſhould Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Offices of the Senſes, both external and alſo internal, and of the Faculties and Affections of the Soul, as alſo of the Organs and various provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of all theſe; I had thought of ſome rational Arguments for that purpoſe, and from the appearances raiſed ſome not unlikely Hypotheſes, which (as uſes to be in theſe kind of buſineſſes) at length accrued into a certain Syſtem of Art and frame of Doctrine. But when at laſt the force of Invention being ſpent, I had handled each again, and brought them to a ſeverer teſt, I ſeemed to my ſelf, like a Painter, that had delineated the Head of a Man, not after the form of a Maſter, but at the will of a bold Fancy and Pencil, and had followed not that which was moſt true, but what was moſt convenient, and what was rather deſired than what was known. Thinking on theſe things ſeriouſly with my ſelf, I awaked at length ſad, as one out of a pleaſant dream; to wit, I was aſhamed that I had been ſo eaſie hitherto, and that I had drawn out for my ſelf and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors a certain Poetical Philoſophy and Phyſick neatly wrought with Novity and Conjectures, and had made a <hi>Fucus</hi> as it were with deceits and incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for either of us.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all delay being laid aſide, I determined with my ſelf ſeriouſly to enter preſently upon a new courſe, and to rely on this one thing, not to pin my faith on the received Opinions of others, nor on the ſuſpicions and gueſſes of my own mind, but for the future to believe Nature and ocular demonſtrations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thenceforward I betook my ſelf wholly to the ſtudy of Anatomy: and as I did chiefly inquire into the offices and uſes of the Brain and its nervous Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, I addicted my ſelf to the opening of Heads eſpecially, and of every kind, and to inſpect as much as I was able frequently and ſeriouſly the Contents; that after the figures, ſites, proceſſes of the whole and ſingular parts ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with their other bodies, reſpects, and habits, ſome truth might at length be drawn forth concerning the exerciſe, defects, and irregularities of the Animal Government; and ſo a firm and ſtable Baſis might be laid, on which not only a more certain Phyſiologie than I had gained in the Schools, but what I had long thought upon, the Pathologie of the Brain and nervous ſtock, might be built.</p>
                  <p>But for the more accurate performing this work, as I had not leiſure, and perhaps not wit enough of my ſelf, I was not aſhamed to require the help of others. And here I made uſe of the Labours of the moſt Learned Phyſician and highly skilful Anatomiſt, Doctor <hi>Richard Lower,</hi> for my help and Companion; the edge of whoſe Knife and Wit I willingly acknowledge to have been an help to me for the better ſearching out both the frame and offices of before hidden Bodies. Wherefore having got this help and Companion, no day almoſt paſt over without ſome Anatomical adminiſtration; ſo that in a ſhort ſpace there was nothing of the Brain, and its Appendix within the Skull, that ſeemed not plainly detected, and intimately beheld by us. After this, when we entred upon a far more difficult task, <hi>viz.</hi> the Anatomy of the Nerves, then very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb facs="tcp:107014:47"/>the plainly to be admired skill of this Man, as alſo his indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and unwearied Labour: For having proſecuted, with a moſt exact ſearch, all the divarications, wandring on every ſide of the Nerve, how minute or ſmall ſoever, and immerſed, and variouſly infolded within other Bodies, and ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Labyrinths of the Branches, and ſhoots of every pair, far and near diffuſed, he drew out with his own hand the Schemes, Images, or Draughts of them, and alſo of many paſſages of the Blood, as they appear in this Tract; which indeed, that they might be faithfully and moſt exactly ſhewn, without any falſity or errour, he cauſed, that no Table might contain ſcarce any line or the moſt light paſſage, whoſe conformation and exact habitude he had not found proved by the marks or inſpection of many Animals for that purpoſe killed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the helps brought me by his moſt skilful diſſecting hand, it becomes me not to hide, how much beſides I did receive from theſe moſt famous Men, Dr. <hi>Thomas Millington</hi> Doctor in Phyſick, and Dr. <hi>Chr. Wren</hi> Doctor of Laws, and <hi>Savill</hi>-Profeſſor of Aſtronomy; both which were wont frequently to be preſent at our Diſſections, and to confer and reaſon about the uſes of the Parts. Beſides, the former most Learned Man, to whom I from day to day propoſed privately my Conjectures and Obſervations, often confirmed me by his Suffrage, being uncertain in my mind, and not truſting to my own opinion. But the other moſt renowned Man, Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> was pleaſed out of his ſingular humanity, wherewith he abounds, to delineate with his own moſt skilful hands many Figures of the Brain and Skull, whereby the work might be more exact.</p>
                  <p>But although inſtructed by theſe helps, and as it were hem'd in by the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſiſtances of theſe Illuſtrious Men, I come forth on the Stage, I preſume I ſhall not be however ſafe from calumny, and free from blame and most juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: becauſe here is inquired into the receſſes and moſt inward dens of the Brain, and its depending parts as it were ſhut and ſealed up; concerning the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uſes of which, ſcarce any thing may be brought forth, but that, as it may be publiſhed and ſhewn, for the Judgments of the more Learned, ſo it may be carpt at and torn by the opprobries of detractors. In other parts, where matters appear to the Senſes, we do not ſo eaſily run upon errours. For in moſt of the Viſcera and Veſſels, the Contents and contained humors, as alſo their paſſages within the larger Cavities of the containing parts, are diſcerned by the ſight: But in the Brain and Nerves, neither the ruſhings on or impreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Animal Spirits themſelves, nor their tracts or footſteps, can any ways be ſeen. Wherefore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the uſes of the Brain, ſeems as difficult a task as to paint the Soul, of which it is commonly ſaid, That it underſtands all things but it ſelf: for in truth, the unwearied labour of the Brain beholds or ſearches the hidden places of other Bodies, in the mean time the oeconomy or regiment of its own Family and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being wholly hid and unknown.</p>
                  <p>But what we profeſs to be performed by us in the following Tract, and hope for the future from the help or labour of others, is chiefly this; to wit, that we have not raſhly deſcribed the parts themſelves, of which the Anatomy is inſtituted, but that we have with diligent care and great truſt collected the various appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Arguments of Obſervations by a manifold Diſſection. Which things, if you ſhall delineate out of thoſe Sentences and granted Decrees, as it were to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Rule, and from thence would collect a Theory, as yet lame, and that may not appear abſolute in all its numbers, no doubt but that a longer time, and the getting of more Obſervations may give it a more perfect form, that Antiquity may not have ſaid altogether in vain, That <hi>Minerva</hi> was born from the Brain, <hi>Vulcan</hi> with his Inſtruments playing the Midwife: For either by this way, <hi>viz.</hi> by Wounds and Death, by Anatomy, and a Caeſarean Birth, Truth will be brought to Light, or for ever lye hid.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AMong the various parts of an animated Body, which are ſubject to Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical diſquiſition, none is preſumed to be eaſier or better known than the Brain; yet in the mean time, there is none leſs or more imperfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. All of it that appears, and is commonly deſcribed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part or forehead, is beheld almoſt at a ſight or two after ſome rude cutting up; but if you ſeek what lyes hid in the receſſes for that end, new boſoms and productions of Bodies, before hid, are every where laid open: yea the parts of the Brain it ſelf are ſo complicated and involved, and their reſpects and habitudes to one another ſo hard to be extricated, that it may ſeem a more hard task to inſtitute its perfect Anatomy, than to delineate on a plain, the flexions and Meanders of ſome Labyrinth: Becauſe, as we are not able to eſtimate the meaſure or to paint forth the pattern or draught of the frame of this, ſo neither of that, unleſs the bulk or ſubſtance of the ſubject be firſt ſearched to the bottom, and its frame broken into pieces. Hence it came to paſs, that the old Anatomiſts in diſſecting the Brain, not ſufficiently attending what was placed firſt, what ſecond, and what after that in the order of Nature, cut its Globe as it were into ſlices or parts, and the Phaenomena ariſing by chance from ſuch a diſſection, they eaſily eſteemed for true parts of the Brain; when yet in the mean time, by others from a diſſection otherwiſe made, the parts and proceſſes of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear far different from the former. The reaſon of which is, becauſe the ſubſtance or frame of the Brain and its Appendix lyes ſo within the Skull, that there are many ſwellings or tuberous riſings, with ſeveral tails or little feet compacted together: all which, although diſtinct one from another, and are endued with figures diverſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded; yet they, that they may be contained in a leſſer room, are thruſt as it were into the ſame Globe, and ſo complicated among themſelves, that it is a hard thing to find out where the beginning and end of the Brain, as alſo where the limits and partitions of the near adjoyning parts do remain; further, that the ſeveral parts of the Encephalon ſo complicated, may retain their ſite, nor preſently being looſned one from another, may ſpring forth, they are knit together into due foldings, with Fibres and Membranes ſtretched out from part to part. And as often as the ſubſtance or bulk of the Brain ſo conglobated or rolled together is cut, there is as often a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the ſlips being cut, the portions of divers parts cleaving together, are carried away with them. Wherefore that a true and genuine deſcription of the Brain might be ſhewed before its ſubſtance and continuity is diſſolved, before all things its whole frame or ſubſtance ought to be explicated, and the knitting of the Membranes being wholly looſned, the ſeveral parts ought to be turned over and ſtretched forth into their proper dimenſions. By what means theſe things may be done, and by what
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107014:48"/>Method the diſſection or Anatomical adminiſtration of the Brain may be beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ought here in the firſt place to be ſhewn; then theſe things being firſt done, we will more largely deliver the Deſcription of the Brain, together with the uſe and action of its ſeveral parts.</p>
                     <p>That the perfect knowledge of the Brain and its parts may be gained, it is neceſſary not only to diſſect and look into mens Heads, but all other kind of living Creatures heads: for beſides, that the humane Heads or Bodies are not ſo readily to be had, that one may from day to day behold the Brain and its frame, and carefully conſider the ſituation of the parts, and ſearch one after another their reſpects, habitudes, and dependencies; beſides alſo, the immenſe bulk of an humane Head is in it ſelf an hindrance, whereby its moſt intricate frame and various receſſes and Appendices are the leſs accurately diſcerned and inveſtigated: all which being reduced into an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, are plainly repreſented more commodiouſly in the diſſection of Beaſts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the form and compoſition of the Brain in a Dog, Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many other four-footed beaſts, were little different (the magnitude only excepted) from the figure of the ſame, and the diſpoſition of the parts, in a man, I was the more ſatisfied to compoſe a certain Anatomy of the Brain by the frequent diſſection of all ſorts of living Creatures. And in this imployment, for that I ſhall ſhew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and differences which the ſubjected parts obtain in various Animals, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared among themſelves, and with Man; certainly from ſuch a compared Anatomy, not only the faculties and uſes of every Organ, but the impreſſions, influences, and ſecret ways of working of the ſenſitive Soul it ſelf will be diſcovered. Concerning the Heads of living Creatures, in the diſſection of which it happened for us chiefly to be exerciſed, it was obſerved, as to the chief parts of the Head, that there was a notable Analogy between Man and four-footed Beaſts, alſo between Birds and Fiſhes: For when the firſt Inhabitants of the new-made World were produced, as one day brought forth Fowl and Fiſhes at once, another in like manner Man and four-footed Beaſts; ſo there is in either twin ſpecies a like form of the Brain; but between that Child of the former, and this of the following day, there is found a great difference as to thoſe parts. For as much therefore as Men and four-footed Beaſts have got more perfect Brains, and more alike among themſelves, we have ordered our Obſervations from their Inſpection: Then afterwards we ſhall deliver the Anatomy of the Brain in Fowl and Fiſhes. And here firſt concerning the Heads of Men and four-footed Beaſts, (as we hinted but now) we will propoſe a Method of Diſſection it ſelf, or of Anatomical Adminiſtration, and will at once recite all the parts one after another, and as it were in a compendious Catalogue; then we will by and by more largely draw out the Particles of the Brain and of its Appendix, ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, in a ſhort Table, and will deſign their uſes and actions for the exerciſe of every faculty.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we had in our hands the Head of a Man, or Dog, Calf, or Sheep, its more outward coverings were taken off; concerning which, as they are well enough known, we are not at all ſolicitous: then the covering of the Skull being divided by a Saw or Inſtrument, and taken away, on every ſide the bones are broken off with a pair of Sciſſers or a Penkniſe to the Baſis of the Skull, that ſo the Contents might, as much as may be, be all made plain or open to the Spectators. What therefore comes firſt in view is the hard Meninx including all the reſt with a common covering. This Membrane outwardly and above is knit to the Skull in divers places, eſpecially about the Sutures; but indeed about the foot or Baſis it moſt ſtrictly cleaves to the bones, ſo that it cannot eaſily be pulled away. Inwardly (or in its hollow ſuperficies) it is lax and looſe enough, unleſs that nigh all its boſoms by the inſertions of the Veins, and in the Baſis of the Skull by the Arteries and the Nerves it is tyed to the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſame Membrane between the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> or diviſion of the Brain, and beſides of the Cerebel it ſelf inſinuating it ſelf deeply on one ſide, and riſing up again on the other, leaves ſome duplicatures or infoldings, in which, being ſhut up above by the increaſe of the ſame Membrane, Cavities, which they commonly call Boſoms, are formed: to wit, by this means, almoſt the three firſt boſoms are conſtituted; but the fourth is a ſmooth and longiſh, and alſo hollow proceſs of the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which is ſent through the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the Brain, nigh the end of the callous body, even to the pineal <hi>Glandula.</hi> The Cavities of the greater Boſoms are ſevered in many places, as it were into little Cells; as it ſeems for that end, that the blood
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107014:48"/>paſſing ſo through the various turnings in thoſe ends, may be hindred from a more rapid motion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, this Meninx or Film of the Brain admits two Arteries from either ſide, one conjugation of which ariſes not far from the Carotick Arteries through the holes of the Cuniform bone, but the other from the bone of the Forehead: all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being diffuſed through the exteriour ſuperficies of the Membrane, water it; but are terminated, partly in the Skull, eſpecially nigh the Sutures, whither they convey the blood, and partly in the boſoms, where, what is ſuperfluous is laid up. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, theſe Arteries perforate the hard Meninge in ſeveral places on the top of the Brain (as <hi>Webſer</hi> obſerves) and impart ſome ſhoots to the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Laſtly, the exteriour ſuperficies of this Meninge is no where planted with ſo many ſhoots of Veins as Arteries; but from its four Boſoms (which are the veinous Receptacles of the blood) many Veins go out through the interiour ſuperficies of this Membrane, which being inſerted in the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> are preſently diſperſed through its whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and the ſame ſliding down on every ſide from the boſoms, meet every where the Arteries aſcending from the Baſis of the Head, and being intermingled with them, conſtitute the manifold infoldings of the Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>That theſe may be the better beheld, after the Arteries are ſufficiently noted, let the hard Meninx be cut round near the border of the broken Skull; then let what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of it ſerves for a covering and partition to the Brain and Cerebel, be lifted up, that the goings out of the Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Veins and their diſtributions into the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> may be conſidered; which being afterwards broken aſunder, let the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane with its boſoms be wholly taken away; but the reliques of this Membrane, which ſtick to the bones at the bottom of the Skull, ſhould be ſeparated; ſo that the whole frame or ſubſtance of the Brain and its Appendix may be ſomewhat clevated, and moved here and there, be every where conſpicuous, and at length taken from the Skull. But that theſe things may be performed, you muſt begin from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior or fore part, where the bone of the Forehead ſeparates it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if the prow of the Brain, hid under this bone, be a little lifted up, the mammillary proceſſes come preſently in ſight, together with the ſmelling Nerves hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; which being diſſected near the inſertion, there will appear an hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in either proceſs. Theſe are large and round, alſo full of clear water in Calves: but in either ſmelling Nerve a manifeſt Cavity is found continued on either ſide to the anterior Ventricles of the Brain, to which if a Pipe be put and blown into, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the whole ſubſtance of the Brain will ſwell.</p>
                     <p>Next the ſmelling Nerves about the Cocks-comb two ſmall Arteries are ſeen to ariſe from the Skull, and to be carried towards the <hi>Interſtitium</hi> of the Brain, which in truth are branches of the Carotides, which are knit to the dilated Comb before, and from thence are ſeen to be reflected to the anterior Brain.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Veſſels being there diſſected, the coming together and going out of the Optick Nerves follow, the trunk of which being cut off a little lower, the Tunnel, and out of both its ſides the Arteries called Carotides, ariſing out of the Cuniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, do appear; which are more clearly beheld, if the Brain be lifted up. Theſe alſo being cut off, and the brain farther bent back, the moving Nerves of the Eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhew themſelves; and ſo from thence the other pairs of Nerves follow in order, that one pair of them being cut off, and the brain with its Appendix more lifted up, the next is ſtill obvious to thoſe beholding it, till all the Nerves ariſing within the Skull, and alſo the Arteries, both the Carotides, and the Vertebral being at length cut off, the whole frame of the Head may be taken out of the Skull.</p>
                     <p>But (that theſe Veſſels may be deſcribed in the ſame order as they are met with in the cutting them up) two ſmall Nerves follow after thoſe moving Nerves of the Eyes, which, for a reaſon hereafter rendred, we call Pathetick. Theſe Nerves higher than the reſt, ariſing behind two round Prominences called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> (the Buttocks and Stones of the Brain) and bending down forward, and entring for a little ſpace under the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> then coming out through the ſame hole, together with the former, from the Skull, are propagated into the ſight of the Eye. This pair is called by <hi>Fallopius</hi> the eighth, by us the fourth.</p>
                     <p>Beneath theſe little Nerves, from both ſides of the annulary protuberance, (which being ſent from the Cerebel compaſſes the oblong Marrow) two Nerves of noted magnitude ariſe, which, after they have paſſed through the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> ſend forth another notable branch on either ſide ſtraight down without the Skull, the other

                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:107014:50"/>branch, by a longer tract, paſſing through both ſides the Skull near the Turky Chair. Theſe Nerves (as is ſhewn afterwards) having gotten a larger Province, are inlarged in the Palate, the parts of the Mouth and Face, and alſo their branches in the Noſe and Eyes, yea they impart roots to the intercoſtal Nerve. We call this pair the fifth, commonly eſteemed the third.</p>
                     <p>Nigh to the beginning of theſe, out of the loweſt foot of the oblong Marrow or Pith, two leſſer Nerves, endued with a ſingle trunk, ariſe, which being dilated for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and preſently entring under the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> come out of the ſame hole with the moving Nerves of the Eyes, and are all carried into the balls of the Eyes. This pair is called by us the ſixth.</p>
                     <p>Next to theſe Nerves follow the auditory or hearing pair, which indeed ariſes higher from the ſides of the oblong Marrow, in what part the Cerebel is hanged to it, <hi>viz.</hi> nigh the leſſer annulary proceſs; from whence it is immediately carried with a double proceſs into the hole of the ſtony Bone: one of its branches is harder, ſerving chiefly for motion, the other altogether medullary and ſofter, as it were only deſtinated to ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>A little lower ariſes the wandring pair, which is commonly called the ſixth. This ſeems to be made of many Nerves, many of which ariſe together; and to them comes another, endued with a greater trunk, which being brought from the end of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Marrow, yea beyond this, out of the ſpinal Marrow, is united with the former. And ſo all being made like a bundle of Nerves, go out through the hole of the hinder part of the Head; through which alſo goes out the greater branch of the internal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vein. This is by us called the eighth pair.</p>
                     <p>Under the wandring pair, almoſt out of the Baſis of the oblong Marrow, another pair ariſes, conſiſting alſo of many Fibres, which going ſtraight down, and being preſently immerſed in the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> comes forth again through a peculiar hole out of the Skull; then either Nerve, being inoculated into the trunk of the wandring pair, is preſently bended back towards the Tongue. In a man, a peculiar protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance grows above the oblong Marrow, out of which the beginning of this Nerve proceeds. This we call the ninth pair.</p>
                     <p>Below this, in the loweſt part of the hinder part of the Head, out of the ſides of the oblong Marrow, where it is about to go into the ſpinal, another pair, conſiſting alſo of many Fibres, ariſes; which tending towards the ſpinal Marrow, enters the <hi>dura Mater</hi> at the ſame place where the vertebral Artery aſcends into the Brain; yet it ariſes out of the boſoms of the bones, but below the firſt Vertebra or Joynt, from whence it is carried into the Muſcles of the hinder part of the Neck, ſo that it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether this pair ought to be called the laſt of the Skull, or the firſt of the Vertebrals.</p>
                     <p>When theſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the aforeſaid Nerves and Arteries, both the Carotides and the Vertebrals, with the jugular Veins (by which the Encephalon is faſtned to the foot or baſis of the Skull) are cut off, and their ends ſtretched out as much as may be; either let them remain in the taken out ſubſtance or frame, whereby the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of all the Nerves may be plainly noted; or the trunks of them being cut off near the roots, may be left in the holes of the Skull, whereby their goings out and diſtributions may be obſerved. The images of either Example are delineated in the firſt and ſecond Table.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs of Diſſection being thus far brought, the reſidue of the Skull ſhews many things worthy conſideration, of which we ſhall ſpeak particularly afterwards. But firſt we ought to view throughly the taken out frame or ſubſtance of the Brain, together with its Appendix, and to examine all its appearances as they follow in the order of Diſſection.</p>
                     <p>The ſubſtance or bulk being taken out, which is of a ſomewhat round figure or ſpherical, it exhibits to the ſight in its ſuperiour and convex part the Brain and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel; but the oblong Marrow, with the utmoſt borders or edges of the ſuperiour bodies, poſſeſſes almoſt all the baſis or its loweſt part. The thinner Meninx covers theſe three placed near, and the outward ſuperficies of them all; nor doth it clothe the ſame looſly, but deeply inſinuating it ſelf into all their cavities and receſſes, covers and binds them ſtrictly. And as this Membrane is every where interwoven, with the folds of the Veſſels, by its ſtretching out, it reaches the ſame to every part and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo waters the whole with a ſufficient afflux of blood. Here we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Veſſels of this Membrane and its protenſion.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:107014:50"/>
                     <p>As to the former, the whole ſuperficies of the frame of the ſubject may be ſeen, covered with the infoldings of Veſſels, as it were with a net admirably variegated or flouriſhed, and its ſight or aſpect ſhews like the picture of a fruit-bearing wood; the Idea of which, the Veſſels of the Brain more aptly repreſent, and are themſelves ſeen better and more diſtinctly, if you firſt ſquirt into the Carotidick Artery ſome black li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. The Veſſels interwoven within the thin Meninge or <hi>Pia Mater</hi> are Arteries and Veins. The Arteries are four, <hi>viz.</hi> two Carotides and two Vertebrals. Out of either ſide of the Tunnel the ends of the cut off Carotidick Arteries ſhew themſelves, the trunks of which aſcending upwards, are preſently diffuſed from either ſide into the anterior and poſterior, or fore and hinder branch. Either pair of theſe inclining one towards the other, are mutually conjoyned: moreover, the poſterior branches ſo joyned, are united with the Vertebral branches (growing together firſt into one trunk.) For the Vertebral Arteries, ariſing from the laſt hole but one of the Skull, fall at firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided through the ſides of the oblong Marrow; then united in its baſis, they go into a ſingle chanel, which meeting with the hinder branches of the Carotides, (as it is ſaid) it is joyned with them; and from that place of the joyning of them together, a noted branch aſcends on either ſide under the edge or rim of the Brain, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dilated upon the ſhanks or ſtocks of the oblong Marrow, is cleft or divided into very many ſmall ſhoots like hairs, ſome of which aſcend to the Glandula's placed behind the Cerebel, but the reſt make the arterious part of the Choroeidal infoldings. The anterior branches of the Carotides, before they are united, ſend from themſelves on either ſide a noted branch, which creeping upwards like a bounding River, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes either Hemiſphere of the Brain as it were into two Provinces; but after the aforeſaid branches are united, preſently departing again from one another, they are carried to the Prow of the Brain, and from thence bending back between its Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, they fall upon the callous body. All theſe Arteries, before and after their mutual joyning together, ſend forth ſhoots and little branches on every ſide, which do not only creep through and intimately bind about the utmoſt compaſs of its Sphere, but its Penetralia and more inward receſſes, like the young branches of Vines. The ramifications or theſe ſorts of branchings, both of the Carotides and of the Vertebrals, are ſhewn in the firſt Table, as they are found in a Man, and as in a Sheep in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, this thinner Meninx or <hi>Pia Mater</hi> cloathing the whole Brain and its parts, as it receives the Arteries aſcending (as hath been ſaid) from a fourfold Fountain, ſo it is ſtuffed throughout with Veins, ſent from four boſoms. Theſe Veſſels mutually meeting are complicated together, and almoſt every where conſtitute by their branches derived from both, and meeting one the other, and variouſly contorted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the net-like or retiform infoldings; which indeed are not only outwardly in the ſuperficies, but in the diffection, where-ever you may ſeparate one part from another, without breaking it, theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels are to be found. Becauſe, if you behold this frame, taken out of the Skull, collecting together the tops of all the turnings and the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> in this Membrane, and covering them with the joynings of the Veſſels, it will make the whole compaſs or frame of the Encephalon appear like a curious quilted ball. But if you go on to caſt abroad this Sphere, and to ſeparate the cleaving parts, knit together, of this Membrane, one from another, you will ſoon find, that this Meninx covers the gapings of the crevices or turning chaps of the Brain, binds the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of either moity or Hemiſphere, draws together the hinder part of the Brain, otherwiſe being lax and hanging looſe, and compaſſing about every border of it, as it were with a Welt, knits it to the oblong Marrow: and what is the chief of all, the univerſal Cortical or ſhelly ſubſtance of the Brain (to wit, in which the animal Spirits are procreated) is covered over with this Membrane plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt frequent infoldings of the Veſſels; notwithſtanding the interior ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Brain being ſtretched out, (which being called the Callous body, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether medullary and white) is not cloathed with this Membrane; but inſtead of it many foldings of Veſſels, commonly called Choroeides, are hung and as it were freely flow within its complicature. The reaſon of which is, becauſe as this part, to wit, the callous body, is rather deſigned for the Circulation than for the generation of Spirits, therefore it admits not a more plentiful influx of blood: nevertheleſs, for as much as there is need of heat, whereby the Spirits may be there more eaſily circulated, the blood being moved, within the Veſſels hanging there through the empty ſpace, might afford heat as it were from a fire kindled within a Stove. But within all the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107014:51"/>other receſſes of the Brain, and beſides within the folds or lappets of the Cerebel, yea and the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> or gaps of both theſe, and of the oblong Marrow, this Meninx inſinuates it ſelf, and inſerts the diſtributions of the Veſſels. In truth, the proten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or out-ſtretching of this Membrane ſeems therefore the more admirable, becauſe having no where a peculiar place of its origine, it not only binds about the Head or Encephalon with a common covering, but alſo cloaths all its parts with proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, and knits together their tops and proceſſes. Yea this Meninx ſeems to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a manifold and diverſe original: for where-ever the gapings or <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of any parts or proceſſes happen, portions of this Membrane there ſpringing forth, cover them all, and gather them together, and reach to them the ramifications or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Veſſels. In a moiſter Brain this Meninx may be eaſily ſeparated, and ample and large portions of it pulled away with the fingers; which being drawn away, the inſertions of the Veſſels, into the ſubſtance of the Brain and its Appendix, every where clearly appear. Laſtly, by this means the brain being thus left naked, unclothed of its Membranes and Coverings, its make or fabrick, and the diſpoſition or order of all its parts are next ſubjected to Anatomical Inſpection.</p>
                     <p>That the Anatomy of the Brain, properly ſo called, might be rightly celebrated, I judge we ought not to proceed after the common way of Diſſection. But whenas the ſubſtance of the whole Head, taken out of the Skull, ſtands in view, firſt let the hinder partition of the brain, where it is knit to the Cerebel and oblong Marrow or Pith, the Membranes being every where cut or pulled off, be freed (as much as it may be) from its cleaving to the ſubjected parts; then it will eaſily appear, that the ſubſtance of the brain is not united to thoſe bodies, but of it ſelf is altogether free and independent of them, unleſs where it is joyned towards the ſuperficies by the knitting of the Membranes. Alſo this keel or hinder part of the brain being divided by this means from the neighbouring parts, if the fore part be bent back, the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow will appear wholly naked, and diſtinct from the brain and Cerebel (unleſs where they are in ſome places hung to it.) Moreover, when the partition of the brain, being looſned from its coheſion, is lifted up, the three Ventricles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called, go into one empty ſpace or mere vacuity, reſulting from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the brain. Beſides, it may be obſerved, how the brain before is only united to the oblong Marrow; and that in two places of its ſhanks, as it were the tops, it is fixed; which <hi>Fornix</hi> ſo called, or arched Vault, is as it were a ſtring or ligament, which ariſing before, where the brain is hanging to it, is carried to its hinder border, to which it is united as it were with two ſtretched out arms, and ſo it holds together the whole frame of the brain, leſt it be rolled out into a plain, ſtill in a ſpherical figure, and firmly binds the ſame to the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow. From the knitting of the other parts of the humane brain divided and lifted upwards, whereby the vacuity reſulting from its infolding, and eſteemed for Ventricles, alſo whereby the <hi>Fornix</hi> or arched Vault and ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, naked and diſtinct, may be beheld, is repreſented by figure in the fourth Table.</p>
                     <p>And truly, this Poſition or Aſpect of the Brain, to wit, when its hinder border or partition, being freed from its coheſion by the Membranes to the oblong Marrow, and elevated, is bent forward, expoſes to be ſeen by the eyes themſelves, its whole frame or ſubſtance, to wit, whatever it hath without or within, or before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and alſo plainly detects what its habitude and reſpect is to the other parts. The chief things of theſe I ſhall add, and in the ſame order wherein they occurred to Inſpection.</p>
                     <p>The figure of the Brain, eſpecially in a man, ſhews ſomewhat globous or ſpherical: the outward ſuperficies is on all ſides noted with chinks turning and winding like to the rollings about of the Inteſtines: each breach or involution, yea the whole circuit of it contains a twofold ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cortical or rindy, which is the outmoſt and of an Aſh-colour; and the medullary or marrowy, which lyes under it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears white. The brain being as it were plowed with theſe kind of rollings about, like ſo many ridges and furrows, is cleft in the middle, and parted as it were into two Hemiſpheres; yet both the moities come together, and are as it were founded in one like white ſubſtance, which covers inwardly, and as it were in Chambers or Vaults, the whole bulk of the brain. This is harder than any other portion of the brain, and as it is altogether medullary, it receives all the marrows of the circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions within it ſelf, and is to them inſtead of a common baſis. In either Hemiſphere of the brain, about the fore parts, this callous body or marrowy ſubſtance, becomes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107014:51"/>more firm and thick by far than in any other place; and there it is on both ſides faſtned to the tops of the oblong Marrow. From thoſe tops, as it were its beginning, this medullary ſubſtance, covering over or chambering or arching the brain, is ſtretched out towards the hinder parts, and by degrees leſſens in its thickneſs: at length the outward border of this ſtretched out, is drawn together more narrowly, and more below, it is conjoyned by the knitting of the Membranes and Veſſels (as we but now mentioned) to the tail of the oblong Marrow. Beſides, for its more firm connexion, a medullary proceſs ariſes from the fore part of the callous body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the tops of it, which ſtretching under the fiſſure or cleft of the brain, reaches to its border; to which it is united, as it were with arms bending on either ſide: which arms indeed embrace the tail of the oblong Marrow, and ſo more firmly knit to it that border of the brain.</p>
                     <p>This medullary proceſs, commonly called the <hi>Fornix,</hi> under its riſe or beginning, hath two white and medullary roots, either of them alike going out from the callous body, which roots nigh the tops, where the brain is hung to them, meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, paſs into the <hi>Fornix</hi> or Vault it ſelf, as if it were a broad proceſs, which ſtretches under the chamber of the brain, like a beam. Under this twofold root of the <hi>Fornix</hi> is laid croſs-wiſe, of the ſame magnitude, a medullary trunk, by which, like a bridge, there is a certain paſſage and communication between two proceſſes of the form of a Lentil, and chamfer'd or furrowed bodies beaming or ſhining in them. Further, from the midſt of the ſuperficies of this <hi>Fornix,</hi> a thin and pellucid hedge or pale is erected, which is affixed to the chanel or furrow of the callous body, almoſt along its whole paſſage. And for this reaſon, whilſt the three-ſided <hi>Fornix</hi> ſtretched underneath a chamber, ariſing from the complication of the brain, it diſtinguiſhed its appearing cavity as it were into three partitions, and ſo cauſed, that in it three Ventricles were repreſented.</p>
                     <p>The interior receſſes of the Brain will lye yet more clearly open, if the border, being on every ſide ſeparated and lifted up, as much as may be, from its cohering with the oblong Marrow, be cut a little further through the ſubſtance at the ſides of the ſame Marrow, to which it is united, nigh the chamfer'd bodies, and alſo the <hi>Fornix,</hi> being cut nigh the roots, be bent back, together with the brain; for then the frame of the brain may be wholly lifted up, turned forward, and unfolded into a plain, ſo that the whole interior ſuperficies of the callous body being ſtretched out into a broad floor, may be ſeen and handled. Where, beſides the medullary, and its moſt white ſubſtance, may be obſerved many white parallel lines, which cut the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the brain in right angles, as if they were certain tracts or footſteps, in which the animal Spirits travel from one Hemiſphere of the brain to the other, and return back again.</p>
                     <p>After this manner, in very many perfect four-footed Beaſts, the frame or ſubſtance of the brain was wont to be turned over, the Sphere being projected into a plain, and its interior ſuperficies to be unfolded into breadth. Alſo this kind of Method of Diſſection may be uſed in a mans brain, where the ſame Phaenomena wholly occur to Anatomical obſervation. The chief difference is, that the bulk of the brain of a man, for that it is very large, and alſo far thicker, and endued with more turnings and windings; therefore it cannot be ſo eaſily and throughly inverted, as that of a Calf or Sheep, and reduced into a broad plain: yet it may be ſo far expanded and lifted up near its border or partition, that all the interior receſſes may appear in view. The third and fourth Figures ſhew the image of an humane brain bent back: but in the ſeventh Table is ſhewn the aſpect or ſight of a Sheeps brain wholly unfolded, and as it were ſpread plain.</p>
                     <p>In the leſſer four-footed Beaſts, as a Mouſe, an Hare, Coney, and ſome others, the ſuperficies of the brain being wholly plain or even, wants the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; however from the complication of the border, and the under-ſtretching of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> there reſults a cavity repreſenting Ventricles.</p>
                     <p>After that we have throughly viewed all things which belong to the Brain, in the order as we have ſaid, let either Hemiſphere, covered within with the callous body, by which it hangs, be divided and removed from the tops of the oblong Marrow: which indeed may be exactly done, by cutting it near to the ſides of the Lentiform prominencies, which are found in the vulgar diſſection of the Head, within the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Ventricles: for thoſe prominences are the tops or heights of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, to which the callous body is immediately fixed. When the brain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107014:52"/>is cut after this manner, that the prominencies, which are the tops of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, may be left naked, let them be cut long-ways through the midſt (to wit, in the medullary part, where they are conjoyned to the callous body) and their interior ſubſtance will appear through the whole chamfered or ſtreaked; <hi>viz.</hi> medullary ſtreaks or chamferings are ſeen to aſcend and deſcend forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; that none may doubt, but that theſe chamferings or ſtreaks were made by Nature, as it were paſſages or chanels for the paſſage and return, or going to and fro of the Spirits out of the callous body into the oblong Marrow, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Figure of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, divided from the Brain, with their tops, which are the chamfered bodies, is expreſſed in the eighth Table.</p>
                     <p>After theſe ſtriated or ſtreaked bodies, the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow being divided for a little ſpace, go forward, then being united, they meet together in the ſame ſtock, made up as it were of two ſtems. But the ſtock or trunk of the oblong Marrow in its whole tract, <hi>viz.</hi> before and after the coalition of its ſhanks, hath many Proceſſes, Appendices, Prominences, and Infertions of Veſſels, ſome of which ariſe from one ſide, and others from the other ſide, and make it unequal, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious productions and protuberances; of which hereafter.</p>

                           <hi>The Parts of the oblong Marrow, and the reſt of the hinder Parts of the Head are recounted, and their Diſſection ſhewn.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving deſcribed both the Meninges, and the ramifications of the Veſſels in them, alſo the fabrick of the Brain, properly ſo called; and next ſhewed its outward partition gathered together into folds about the ſhanks of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Marrow, and either middle or marrowy part of it hung to the chamfered bodies; we will now follow the remaining parts of the Head in order.</p>
                     <p>The chamfered or ſtreaked bodies, or the tops of the oblong Marrow, are two lentiform Prominences, which are beheld within the former Ventricles of the Brain, as they are commonly termed; the heads of theſe, which are more large and blunt, incline mutually one to another, and are almoſt contiguous. Out of the angle of this inclination the <hi>Fornix</hi> ariſes with a double root; to which is ſubjected or underlaid a certain tranſverſe medullary proceſs, and ſeems to knit together theſe ſtreaked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as may be ſeen in the ſeventh Table GG: but the ends of thoſe bodies, being made ſharper, are reflected outward, and make as it were two ſides, with a ſharp triangle, to whoſe anterior ſuperficies the marrow of the callous body ſticks for a long tract; where, if theſe bodies be cut long-ways through the midſt, the medullary ſtreaks (as was already ſaid) will preſently appear. The figure and place of theſe, as alſo the medullary chamferings, are truly repreſented in the eighth Table.</p>
                     <p>Where the ſtreaked bodies end, the chambers or <hi>Thalami,</hi> as they are termed, of the optick Nerves, poſſeſs the next part to the oblong marrow; to wit, in this place,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107014:53"/>its ſhanks riſe into unequal protuberances, out of the ridges of which the Optick Nerves ariſe, and from thence, being bent down in the fore-part with a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, they joyn together about the baſe of the ſame marrow, and ſeem to be united; by and by being again parted, and going forward towards the ball of the Eye, they go out of the Skull. In this place the ſhanks of the oblong marrow in a Man are for the moſt part diſtinct, and gaping one from another, leave a deſcending opening, which is the paſſage to the Tunnel; but in moſt four-footed Beaſts the ſhanks of the ſame medullary ſtocks are there diſtinct, only a little lower, and have a chink cut for the Tunnel: but the ridges of them, in which the beginnings of the Optick Nerves lye hid, are ſomewhat conjoyned, and for the ſpace of half an inch do grow together. Wherefore in Brutes there is one hole before this growing together, and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, both which lead towards the Tunnel. The reaſon of this difference is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a Man, for that the frame or ſubſtance of the brain it ſelf is very large, and that its marrowy parts are remote one from another, it is behoveful for its ſhanks, whereby the tops of the oblong marrow may be the better fitted to the ſame, to be ſeparated, and from their mutual touching to be bent into a greater aperture. Hence it is obſerved, that in a Man the ſhanks of the oblong marrow, from the hanging on of the brain, go forward with a greater angle of inclination, and with a certain bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compaſs; but in Brutes the ſame lye almoſt parallel. After what manner theſe parts are ſormed in an humane brain the third and fourth Figure ſhews; after what manner they are in four footed Beaſts is ſhewn in the ſeventh Figure.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame ridges of the medullary ſhanks, from whence the Optick Nerves take their origines, certain medullary proceſſes ariſing, and being dilated on either ſide above the brim of the ſecond hole, grow together about the root of the pineal Glandula. Theſe proceſſes (as it ſeems) are thoſe parts, which the Famous <hi>Cartes</hi> ſuppoſes to be Nerves belonging to the pineal Glandula: but I rather ſuſpect them to be productions only, by which the Optick Nerves may alſo communicate near their origines. Their figure is very well deſcribed in the ſeventh Table.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Thalami</hi> or Chambers of the Optick Nerves, other notable protuberances, commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> the Buttocks and Teſticles (of the brain) grow to the ſuperior part of the medullary Trunk or ſtem, and cover its ſuperficies about the ſpace of an inch; and for that they are not contiguous in the midſt, there is under them a certain hollowneſs in their whole tract. Theſe protuberances are leſſer in a Man, alſo in a Dog and Cat; laſtly, if we obſerved rightly, in other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are newly brought forth, that are impotent, and not inſtructed for the finding out of ſood. In a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and the like, they appear far greater: in Fiſhes and Fowls they are wholly wanting.</p>
                     <p>In number they are four, <hi>viz.</hi> two grow to either ſide of the oblong marrow. The former called <hi>Nates</hi> or the Buttocks, ſeem the greater and principal; to which the other latter called <hi>Teſtes</hi> or the Teſticles, hang as if growing out of them. As to their figure, they are round, and are commonly taken for two ſhanks on either ſide of the brain and Cerebel planted near, which being bent inwardly, and turned back one towards the other, are ſaid to grow together, and ſo to conſtitute the oblong marrow. But this opinion, as we ſhall ſhew more largely hereafter, by the diſſection ordered according to our Method, is clearly falſe. For it plainly appears, that the brain is fixed, long before theſe bodies, to the oblong marrow; nor is there any commerce between theſe and that, unleſs very remote.</p>
                     <p>But if the ſite of theſe parts, and their reſpects and habitudes to the neighbouring bodies, be well noted, it will appear plainly, that they make as it were a certain peculiar Region wholly diſtinct from the Brain and Cerebel, alſo from the oblong marrow it ſelf. Their ſituation is remote enough from the fore-parts, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated by the Cavity or Ventricle under-lying from the medullary ſtock or ſtem: yea a proper way, or one proceſs, ſeems to lead from the long marrow into theſe prominences, and another to go from them, and thence to be carried into the Cerebel. From hence we may ſuſpect, that theſe prominences (eſpecially the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or of the ſhape of a Buttock, which are the chief) are certain places of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which the animal Spirits go apart in their paſſage from the oblong marrow into the Cerebel, and from this to that on the other ſide, and there ſtay for ſome animal uſes, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter. As to the way, which leads from the oblong marrow into theſe prominences; it is manifeſt, that beneath the origines of the Optick Nerves on either ſide a medullary Proceſs deſcends, with little Villages
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107014:53"/>proper for it ſelf, which terminates in the aforeſaid prominencies. Then, if from theſe, you look for a paſſage out, it is equally clear, that from the hindermoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences, which are called <hi>Teſtes,</hi> on either ſide, a medullary proceſs doth obliquely aſcend, which being dilated into the Cerebel, is divaricated through its whole frame. But that the Natiform or Buttock-formed Prominences are Principals, and the <hi>Teſtes</hi> their dependences, or the heads of medullary Proceſſes, which are carried from thence into the Cerebel, manifeſtly appears in a Sheep, Calf, or Horſe, and in ſome others, where the <hi>Nates</hi> are of a noted magnitude, the <hi>Teſtes</hi> of a very ſmall bulk grow to them, and in the middle between theſe the medullary Proceſſes, the Appendices of the former Prominences, exiſt. The aforeſaid Prominences, as alſo the medullary Proceſſes, which lead forward and backward, to and from them, are aptly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the fourth Table, but yet more clearly in the eighth Table TT. PP.</p>
                     <p>Further, becauſe the animal Spirits reſiding in either Promptuary and Appendix, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are carried to the Brain, ought to be confounded and mingled together, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two prominences of either ſide do mutually grow together as it were with wings ſtretched out one to another; but for as much as it is behoveful for thoſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings together to be diſtinguſhed from the oblong marrow, therefore an hollowneſs comes between, which is by ſome eſteemed the fourth Belly, and by others a paſſage to it. Theſe prominences in a Man, Dog, and Cat, and ſome other Animals (as was above mentioned) are very ſmall, and almoſt even; alſo they appear, as the other portion of the oblong marrow, of a white colour. In a Calf, Sheep, Horſe, and many other four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Beaſts, the former protuberances, commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> or Buttocks, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably great, alſo outwardly they appear to be of a fleſh colour, becauſe they are cloathed with the thin Meninx or <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> which contains in it ſelf very many Veins and Arteries; which if ſeparated, the interior ſubſtance of thoſe parts is of a wanniſh colour, and ſuch as is not in all the oblong marrow or pith beſides. But it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as in Brutes, ſo in Man, the hinder or poſterior prominences are Epiphyſes or additions of the former, and that from theſe additions or dependences the medullary proceſſes aſcend obliquely into the Cerebel; near which, other proceſſes cutting thoſe, deſcend direct from the Cerebel, which ſeem not to be inſerted into the medullary Trunk, but going about it, do conſtitute the annulary or ringy protuberance. This annulary protuberance is greater in a Man than in any other Creature. Beſides, it is obſerved, that where ever the ſuperior prominence of the Buttock-form is larger, this inferior annulary is very ſmall; and ſo on the contrary. Further, thoſe medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary proceſſes, aſcending towards the Cerebel, communicate mutually among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the other tranſverſe medullary proceſs; and out of this tranſverſe proceſs, two ſmall little Nerves ariſe, the fourth pair of thoſe which we have recounted, and which are called by us Pathetical. Each of theſe, delineated in fit figures, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Table ſhews clear enough.</p>
                     <p>Not ſar from the aforeſaid Prominences, to wit, between theſe and the Chink, which is called the <hi>Anus</hi> or Arſe-hole, the Pineal Glandula or Kernel is placed. This is put in a Valley, which lyes between the Natiform protuberances, and thoſe which are the Chambers or <hi>Thalami</hi> of the Optick Nerves; in which place that Glandula or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is fixed, ſometimes by very many ſmall Fibres, and ſometimes by two noted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary roots ſubjected to the part; and beſides, it is included in a Membrane, which is a portion of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> as in a Cheſt; and as this Membrane is ſtuffed with very many Arteries and Veins, ſome ſmall Veſſels alſo enter into this Glandula.</p>
                     <p>Under the Prominences but now deſcribed, (as was above hinted) a narrow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or Ventricle is ſtretched out with a long paſſage, which, although it obtains ſome egregious uſes, yet it ſelf ſeems to be only ſecondary, and as it were by chance; for that the proceſſes of either prominence ought to be conjoyned among themſelves, and to be diſtinguiſhed from the under lying medullary Trunk. Two holes lye open into this Trunk, one of which is placed in the beginning, and the other in the end of it, and through the middle of its paſſage the down-bending aperture tends towards the Tunnel; ſo that the ſerous humor entring at either hole, may preſently ſlide away into the Tunnel. Moreover, into the ſame aperture of the Tunnel there lyes open another paſſage, to wit, through the firſt hole, which is placed near the roots of the <hi>Fornix;</hi> ſo that from every quarter of the Head the ſeroſities might be carried into that ſink: to wit, that through the firſt hole, from the infoldings or the anterior Ventricles of the Brain; through the ſecond hole, the humors which are gathered about the orbicular prominences, do come away; and through the third hole, thoſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107014:54"/>which are laid up nigh the confines of the Cerebel, do find a paſſage. Theſe ſeveral holes, with the diſtinct ways to the Tunnel, are plainly delineated in the ſeventh Table H. M. T.</p>
                     <p>Above the Pineal Kernel, as it were above the Button, the infolding of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeides ſeems to be hung; now this infolding is made after this manner: out of either ſide of the oblong marrow, where the border of the brain is knit to it, two Arteries ariſing from the poſterior branches of the Carotides, where they are united to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrals, do directly aſcend; which being preſently divided, like many Rivers planted near together, are carried towards the pineal Glandula, and there ſeem to be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a mutual meeting: and in that place, out of the fourth boſom, ſent down upon the pineal Glandula, the veinous branches come out on both ſides, which in like manner being divided into filaments or ſmall threads, meet with the capillary or hairy Arteries, and are in many places inoculated into them, and variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with them; and ſo theſe Veſſels, being Net-like, much interwoven among themſelves, and interſerted with the Glandula's, do conſtitute the to be admired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings. Theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels, as it were with two out ſtretched wings, are thruſt out on either ſide upon the ſhanks of the oblong marrow, even to the ſtreaked bodies; but yet they only lye upon their ſuperficies, nor are they more firmly affixed either to the oblong marrow, or to the callous body by any inſertions of the Veſſels; ſo that the blood ſeems only to be brought to theſe places, and carried away without any afflux of it made into the ſubjected parts; for what uſes ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter. The Choroidal infoldings, with the pineal Glandula, are drawn out in the ſeventh Table G. F. E.</p>
                     <p>And thus far concerning the appearances ſound above the oblong Marrow, between the ſtreaked bodies and the Cerebel; which indeed are almoſt conſtantly after a like manner both in Man and four-footed Beaſts, unleſs that they only differ in bigneſs. Within this ſpace, in the Pedeſtal or Baſis of the ſame Marrow, many things worth noting occur: For beſides the ends of the cut off Veſſels, which are above recited, the ſite and ſtructure of the Infundible or Tunnel deſerve conſideration. For behind the coalition or joyning together of either Optick Nerve between the ſhanks of the oblong marrow there gaping, is ſent down a receptacle as it were tubulated or made like a Pipe, covered without with a thin Membrane ariſing from the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and defended within with a medullary ſubſtance. The oriſice of this is placed higher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhanks of the oblong marrow, and receives their bending aperture; from thence a ſhort Tube or Pipe being ſent down, is inſerted to the pituitary Glandula or Kernel. We ſee this Tube in an Horſes brain greater than a Gooſes quill, alſo ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and full of clear water; that it is not to be doubted, but that by this way the ſerous humors ſlide away from the brain to the pituitary Glandula: but how theſe humors are carried away from thence, ſhall be afterwards inquired into, becauſe they are not carried into the Palate or roof of the mouth, as is commonly believed.</p>
                     <p>Nigh the lower border of the Tunnel, in a Man, underneath there are two whitiſh Glandula's; though in Brutes only one, but greater, is found. What is the proper uſe of this part ſhall be told hereafter: in the mean time, whether it be doubled or only one larger, it ſeems to be as it were inſtead of a bank to defend or preſerve the thin Membrane of the Tunnel, leſt it ſhould be broken or thruſt out of its place: on the other ſide the growing together of the Optick Nerves ſerves inſtead of the ſame kind of defence.</p>
                     <p>What beſides is contained in this ſpace are only the ſhanks of the oblong marrow it ſelf, which proceed directly from the chambers of the Optick Nerves towards the hinder part of the Head in a ſtraight paſſage; and when both grow together below the Tunnel, they are afterwards diſtinguiſhed in their whole tract by a line drawn through the midſt. Theſe ſhanks of a mans brain are far larger than in brute beaſts: to wit, in that they ſeem to be made up of very many medullary chords or ſtrings joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, as if in this common paſſage and high-way of the animal Spirits, they were ſo many diſtinct paths, which the Spirits enter into reſpectively, according to the various impulſes of ſenſe and local motion. Moreover, this ſpace of the oblong marrow therefore appears ſhorter and more broken in a man, becauſe much of it is hid by the annulary protuberance, which is ſent from the Cerebel, and is very big. The <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> all about covering the ſides of this medullary Trunk, cloaths them with moſt thick infoldings of the Veſſels; by which heat and the nervous juyce are carried, as a continual proviſion for the Spirits, taking a long journey. Thus much
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107014:54"/>for the firſt Section, or anterior portion of the oblong marrow: now our order car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us to the inſpection of its hinder Region, to wit, where the Cerebel grows to it; and the Proceſſes ſent from this either compaſs about its Trunk, or are inſerted into it; out of which alſo, the other Nerves produced within the Skull, take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. Concerning theſe we will ſpeak in order.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BElow the orbicular Prominences, the Cerebel follows to be inſpected. The figure of this, like the Brain, is ſomewhat globous, alſo it appears unequal, marked with certain turnings and windings about; the ridges and furrows of whoſe turnings about the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> ſtretches over, and reaches out the infoldings of the Veſſels to them all, and deeply inſerts them into all. However the Cerebel is diverſiſied or variegated with its turnings and rollings about, not as the Brain, after an uncertain manner; but its folds are diſpoſed in a certain orderly ſeries; for the exterior frame of it ſeems to conſiſt of thin lappets, or little rings or circles, being contiguous and infolded, alſo going about through the whole compaſs with a parallel ſite or ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Either Region of the Cerebel, to wit, the former and the hinder, is terminated in a proceſs in form of a Worm. According to theſe ends, as it were in a double Pole, theſe Circles are very ſhort; thence aſcending towards the top or Equator, they are by degrees enlarged, as it were Parallels in a Sphere or Globe. Theſe Circles are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Cortical or barky, and within medullary, and all their marrowy parts paſs into two ample middles; which indeed ſeem to be the ſame in the Cerebel, as the callous body in the brain.</p>
                     <p>The Cerebel in ſome Animals conſiſts of one frame, and all its little circles are placed in the ſame parallel ſite, and keep the ſame proportion among themſelves; but in others there grow to the Cerebel as it were the primary Sphere, and endued with greater circles, ſome other bodies as it were Wens or Extuberances, or additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spheres marked with leſſer circles. Theſe being eccentrick to the Cerebel it ſelf, have oftentimes labels or folds ordered in a diverſe ſeries from it.</p>
                     <p>But the Cerebel it ſelf (whether it hath theſe little Excreſcences growing to it or not) is found almoſt in all Animals of the ſame figure and proportion, alſo made up of the ſame kind of labels or lappets. Thoſe which have the brain diverſly framed from a Mans, as Fowl and Fiſhes, alſo among four-legged Creatures, Conies and Mice, whoſe brains want turnings about or convolutions, have the like ſpecies and the like diſpoſition of the folds and compoſure of the other parts of the Cerebel. The reaſon of this difference in the brain, and of the conformity in the Cerebel, is rendred hereafter, when we treat of the Uſe of the Parts.</p>
                     <p>As the Brain, within its Cavity, hath the Choroidal infolding made up of Arteries and Veins variouſly complicated, and of Glandula's thickly interſerted; ſo alſo the Cerebel hath got the like infoldings of Veſſels, and thoſe marked with very many Glandula's, and greater than thoſe in the Choroidal infolding. Theſe infoldings and heap of Kernels, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being ſeparated, which clothes the hinder part of the Cerebel, eaſily appear in ſight; for in that place theſe creep upwards on either ſide nigh the Worm-ſhaped proceſs, as it were with two branches; and receive the Artery on either ſide, from the Vertebral Artery, lying under the Baſis of the oblong mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and the veinous paſſages, ſent from either lateral boſom. We ſhall inquire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after into the uſe of this Infolding and of its Glandula's.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, that we may deſcribe the ſite and hanging on of the Cerebel; the ſame ſtanding on the oblong marrow ſeems to be fixed to its ſides, as it were by two little feet; between which, planted on either ſide, and the Cerebel placed above, and the trunk of the long marrow below, (becauſe all theſe ſhould be diſtinct one from the other) there comes a cavity or hollowneſs between, which is commonly called the four Bellies.</p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:107014:55"/>
                     <p>In either little foot, ſuſtaining the Brain, are found three diſtinct medullary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. The firſt of theſe, ſent from the orbicular Protuberances, aſcends obliquely; the ſecond deſcending ſtraight from the Cerebel, and paſſing through the other acroſs, compaſſes about the oblong marrow; the third proceſs, deſcending from the hinder Region of the Cerebel, is inſerted into the oblong marrow, and increaſes its trunk as it were with an additional cord or ſtring. Theſe ſeveral Proceſſes are truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſeventh Table Q. P. R.</p>
                     <p>But as to what belongs to the annular or ringy Protuberance, by which the medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Trunk, both in Man, and in ſome four-footed Beaſts, is compaſſed about, that is made after this manner. The ſecond or middle proceſs of the Cerebel, deſcending ſtraight to the oblong marrow, ſeems not to be implanted in it, aſſoon as it touches its ſides, but growing into a larger bulk, goes about the ſuperficies of the ſame marrow with divers circular Fibres. And ſo when in either ſide both thoſe kind of proceſſes of the Cerebel, being dilated or carried from the top of the medullary Trunk toward its Baſis, do mutually meet, they make that circular protuberance. The ſubſtance of this is far larger in a Man than in any other Animal; in an Hare, Rabbet, Mouſe, and the like, it is very ſmall; in Fowl it is either wholly wanting, or for its ſmalneſs ſcarce to be diſcerned by the eyes. Concerning its bulk, this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obſervation. They who have the orbicular prominences before the Cerebel ſmall, have this annulary protuberance very big; and on the contrary, they who have thoſe prominences big or very great, have this ring very ſmall: further, they who wholly want the Buttock-form protuberances, as in Fowl, ſeem alſo to want this annulary.</p>
                     <p>In many brute Animals, but not in Man, nigh to this greater Protuberance, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower, another leſſer, in like manner orbicular, ſtands, and compaſſeth about the ſuperficies of the oblong marrow; the root of which is a white and medullary line, ſtretched out under the Cerebel, above the bottom of the fourth Ventricle. From the ſides of this leſſer protuberance the auditory Nerves ariſe: In Man the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or hearing Nerves are ſeen to ariſe out of the utmoſt brim of the greater protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance, in like manner they have for their root a white medullary line covering the fourth Ventricle.</p>
                     <p>That this line, and the three diſtinct medullary Proceſſes, which conſtitute either little foot of the Cerebel, may be more plainly ſhewn, alſo that the moſt inward frame of the Cerebel may be viewed, its whole globe ought to be cut through both Poles, <hi>viz.</hi> in the middle through the Vermiform or Worm-ſhaped proceſſes; then it will plainly appear, that in either Hemiſphere there is an ample middle or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wherein the marrowy branches, being ſtretched abroad on every ſide, like thoſe of a tree, ſpread through the Cortical ſubſtance of the Cerebel, every where diffuſed; and that in either middle or marrowy part, the three diſtinct proceſſes, which make either trunk, or little foot of the Cerebel, are inſerted. Each of theſe are fitly repreſented in the ſeventh Table.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Cerebel, and by what means it is faſtned to the oblong marrow, Beſide theſe, it is to be obſerved, that about the bottom of the Baſis of the oblong marrow, out of the greater Ring, come out two medullary ſtrings, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the reſt of the medullary Trunk, go right forward towards the ſpinal marrow, and in its progreſs, being made ſtraiter by degrees, like Pyramids, after about the ſpace of an inch, end in ſharp points. The extremities of theſe conſiſt on the other ſide, where the wandring pair of Nerves have their orignal, and make a certain riſing up in the oblong marrow. Hence it is likely, that theſe ſtrings are paſſages or chanels of the animal Spirits, wherein they are carried from the greater Ring, or what is the ſame thing, from the Cerebel into the wandring pair, and the beginnings of other Nerves implanted near; for what end, ſhall be ſaid hereafter. Theſe pyramidal Bodies do not ſo manifeſtly appear ſo long as the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> clothes them, and hides them with the infoldings of the Veſſels; but this Membrane being pulled away, they are ſo conſpicuous, eſpecially in a Man and a Dog, that they ſeem like greater Nerves. In thoſe Animals, where the annulary Protuberance is greater, theſe proceſſes being brought from the ſame in right angles, are greater and more conſpicuous; and on the contrary, in Fowl they are clearly wanting.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not our intent, nor will it be needful for us to delineate the figures and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral Bones of the Brain-pan, or to deſcribe their various holes, which tranſmit the Trunks of the Veſſels like the hanging weights of a Clock. All theſe are well enough known; ſo that to treat of theſe Gates or Entries is ſuperfluous. Beſides alſo, by what means the Nerves, ariſing within the Skull with their ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or branching forth, enter the dens and caverns of the Bones, ſhall be delivered particularly afterwards. Wherefore for the preſent our buſineſs ſhall be only to take notice of ſome things, chiefly worth noting, concerning the ſanguiferous Veſſels paſſing through the Cuniform or Wedge-like Bone, not ſufficiently noted by others.</p>
                     <p>Among the various uſes and offices which the Cuniform or Wedge-like Bone yields to the Brain and its Appendix, it is not of the leaſt note or moment, that it tranſmits the Carotidick Arteries, not without a certain mechanical or artificial proviſion; and that in the middle way, by which they muſt paſs, it contains the pituitary Kernel, and ſometimes the wonderful Net. Each of theſe deſerve conſideration; the more, for that in divers Animals they are after a different manner; and becauſe it is much controverted among Phyſicians concerning their frame and uſe. But we will firſt ſpeak of the pituitary Glandula, becauſe this part, being placed higher, is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Anatomical Inſpection before others.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>youth's brain</figDesc>
                        <head>Fig. IIII.</head>
                     </figure>
                     <p>This Glandula is found in all perfect Creatures; for Man, all four-footed Beaſts, yea Fowl and Fiſhes are provided or endued with it: from whence we may conclude it to have ſome neceſſary uſes in the Brain. But as to its quantity or bigneſs, its proportion is various in divers Animals, according to the bigneſs of the head and body wherein it is; becauſe in a Lamb it is greater than in a Man or a Dog; alſo its bulk in a Horſe is leſſer than in an Ox. But the reaſon of this difference ſeems to conſiſt in this chiefly, for that the pituitary Glandula in ſome, reſpects the bulk of the brain only laid upon it, and in others both the brain and the Carotidick Arteries aſcending near it; and ſo as it hath a reſpect to both theſe together, or only to one, its ſubſtance or bulk is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater or leſſer. For truly in ſome Animals the Carotidick Arteries being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated within the Skull, are preſently divaricated into Net-like infoldings, and from thoſe infoldings many ſhoots of the Veſſels every where enter this Glandula, and are interwoven into its ſubſtance. Further, becauſe this infolding of the Veſſels, called the wonderful Net, is found very large in ſome, and in others very ſmall; therefore this Kernel, for as much as it admits from theſe, few branches, and from thoſe far more, and in ſome other Animals ſcarce any ſhoots from the Arteries, anſwers to this divers diſtributions of the Veſſels, with the various proportion of its bulk. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is obſerved in ſome Animals, as chiefly in a Man and a Horſe, that this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Net is wholly wanting; and whereas in ſuch, either Artery is carried about by a long compaſs between the receſſes of this bone; from its trunk in a man ſometimes one or two ſhoots, ſometimes none, are carried into the pituitary Kernel; alſo in an Horſe fewre branches enter into it, and ſo its bulk in theſe becomes leſſer.</p>
                     <p>But in very many other Animals (eſpecially thoſe who have the wonderful Net) it may be proved, beſides ocular inſpection, alſo by this Experiment, that many ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels enter this Glandula: for if an inky liquor be ſquirted into the Caroti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with a Syringe, the exterior part of the Glandula, that is interwoven with the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying Veſſels, will be very much dyed with a black colour. Wherefore without doubt, it may be thought, that this Glandula doth receive into it ſelf the humors, to wit, flowing into it from the Tunnel in all kind of living Creatures, and in ſome from the branches of the Carotides. Yet by which way theſe humors are carried away again, doth not ſo plainly appear; for we affirm, with the moſt Learned <hi>Schneider,</hi> that they do not at all fall down into the Palate through the holes of the under-lying bone. Yet in the mean time, we ſuppoſe thoſe holes to be only made to procure lightneſs to the bone; becauſe in thoſe Animals, which have the greater pituitary Kernel, thoſe holes in the bone are more and larger: further, I have often found veſſels or chanels to be contained between thoſe holes: and when I had injected Ink within the great hole of the ſame bone in a Calf, the black liquor preſently entred the leſſer Veſſels ſubject to the bone, and at laſt the Jugular Vein. And by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment chiefly we conjecture concerning the office and duty of this Glandula; of which we ſhall ſpeak more fully hereafter, when we inquire into the uſe of this and the Tunnel.</p>
                     <p>Nigh to either ſide of the pituitary Kernel, if the <hi>dura Mater</hi> be opened, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidick Artery lyes ſtretched out upon the wedge-like bone, about the length of an inch: for as this Artery riſes up below the Turky Chair, ſometimes higher, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times farther within the Skull; the ſame being preſently bent in from its firſt aſcent, goes in under the <hi>dura Mater</hi> till it comes to the anterior border of the ſame Chair; where again being intorted, and being ſent forth upwards with a certain compaſs, it perforates the hard Meninx, and is carried ſtraight towards the Brain. So this Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with its double aſcent and crookedneſs (to wit, above the Baſis of the Skull, and then above the hard Meninx, together with its ſituation, ſtretcht out in length under the ſame) repreſents in moſt the letter <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The Carotidick Artery in all Animals aſcends obliquely within the Skull; but as to its ſite or protenſion nigh the pituitary Glandula, it is not after the ſame manner in all: for in a man paſſing through the Canal-bone, peculiarly ingraven by it, with a ſingle Trunk, it lyes every where ſtretched out at length; and out of this Trunk it ſends forth ſometimes, though not always, ſome ſhoots to the pituitary Glandula. Alſo in a Horſe, its Trunk is ſingle; but where it firſt ariſes within the Skull, either Carotides, through the croſs branches ſent from one ſide to the other, before they perforate the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> communicate among themſelves. And as in moſt other living Creatures, the Artery, however before branched forth, yet being made one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Trunk, goes into the Brain; in a Horſe either Carotick Artery being parted in two, ſends forth upwards two branches, ariſing from the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> in two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct places.</p>
                     <p>In a Dog, Fox, Sheep, Calf, Stag, and many other four-footed beaſts, either of the Carotides, whilſt hid within the Skull under the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> being divided into ſmall ſhoots, and complicated with other Veſſels, to wit, both Veins and nervous Fibres, conſtitutes the Net-like infoldings; which infoldings, being ſtretched out on either ſide of the Turky Chair, fill the cavity there exiſting; then after manifold divarications of all the Veſſels, ſome arterious ſhoots being diſintangled from the others, and again united, grow together into one Trunk, which boring thorow the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> paſles ſtraight into the Brain.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid Infolding is, commonly called the wonderful Net, and that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, for there is nothing in the whole fabrick of the animal Body more worthy of admiration; in which, beſides the arterious little branches which proceed from either of the aſcending Carotides, the veinous ſhoots, though fewer, meet with thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the inward Jugular branches; and both kinds of Veſſels being divided into ſmall ſhoots, like a bundle of twiſted ſilk, are variouſly folded together: which complications of the Veſſels however are ſuſtained by the nervous Fibres, ſupplied from the greater Trunk of the fifth pair of Nerves. The aforeſaid infolding of the Veſſels or wonderful Net in ſome Animals is far greater, and contains much more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications of the Veſſels than it hath in others; for in a Calf, Sheep, Goat, which are fed with graſs, its frame is larger than in a Dog, Cat, and other fleſh-eating and hotter Brutes. Further, it is obſervable, where the wonderful Net is greater, that the infolding of one ſide is ingrafted into the infolding of the other oppoſite ſide, and that from both, many more ſhoots of the Veſſels do enter into the pituitary Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; ſo indeed, that if you ſhall inject Ink into the Trunk of the Artery below the Skull, the Veſſels on either ſide, or the infoldings, will be dyed with the ſame tincture, and the black liquor will flow out of the Trunk of the oppoſite Artery.</p>

For when the anterior boſoms transfer their load into the two Laterals, which are the poſterior, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves end in the Jugular Veins, it is obſerved, that thoſe latter boſoms have furrows or cavities inſculped whereby they may ſettle or reſt upon the hinder part of the Head: and whenas either boſom, through a proper hole, being about to go into the Jugular Vein, ſlides out of the Skull; nigh that hole, in the outward part of the Skull, a round and ample den is made hollow, and covered over by the extremity on either ſide of the ſame boſom, inlarged into a greater capacity, to the end, that the blood, whilſt it ſlides forth out of the Head with a full torrent, ſhould not ruſh into the Veins with too rapid and vertiginous an influx, and ſo make a forcible entry on the Heart it ſelf, therefore it hath here a diverſion large enough, in which eſtuating or boiling up, till a more free and open ſpace may be granted to its courſe, it may be ſtaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble. Certainly there can be nothing more artificial thought upon, and that can better argue the Providence of the great Creator, than this fit or convenient diſpoſition of the blood in the brain, and without it, and the way of its reciprocation in divers Animals, accommodated to the neceſſity of every one. And laſtly, in the diſſection of Beaſts, other miracles of the ſame nature happen, whereby ſhewing the finger and Divine workmanſhip of the Deity, a moſt ſtrong and invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be oppoſed to the moſt perverſe Atheiſt.</p>

                           <hi>The Brains of Fowls and Fiſhes deſcribed.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHat hitherto we have ſhewn concerning the deſcription of the Brain and its Appendix, we chiefly owe to the obſervations made of the diſſection of the Heads of a Man and of four-footed Beaſts. We ſhall now proceed to the commenting upon theſe Obſervations; to wit, that we may endeavour, from the fabrick rightly conſidered of the parts of the Brain, ſo deſcribed, to erect their offices and uſes, and ſo to deſign the government of the animal Function: But becauſe a compared Anatomy may yield us a more full and exact Phyſiology of the Uſe of Parts; therefore before I enter upon this task, it will ſeem worth our labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Heads of ſome other Animals, to wit, of Fowls and Fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>We have already hinted, that the Brains of Men and of four-footed Beaſts, were alike in moſt things; and alſo that the contents in the Heads of Fowls and Fiſhes being far different from both the former, yet as to the chief parts of the Head, are found to have between themſelves an agreement. The kinds of either Animals being coetaneous, and as it were Twins from the Creation of the World, do teſtifie their affinity in nothing more than in the fabrick of the Brain. That it is ſo in Man and four-footed Beaſts plainly appears already: we ſhall now ſee if that the Anatomy of Fowls and Fiſhes will ſhew us any thing worthy of note.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <figDesc>interior of a calf's skull</figDesc>

                     </figure>
                     <p>This ſuperior Membrane or hard Meninx being cut off, and ſeparated round about the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> appears very thin, which is not, as in man or other perfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, marked with ſuch frequent infoldings of the Veſſels; but this moſt ſubtil Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninx being made of a texture of Fibres, only clothes, and every where intimately binds about the even and plain ſuperficies of the brain contained within, and wholly deſtitute of turnings and windings about.</p>
                     <p>The fabrick of the brain in Fowls is otherwiſe than in man or four-footed beaſts: for beſides that in its compaſs the inequalities and the turnings and windings are wholly wanting; alſo more inwardly, the callous body and the <hi>Fornix,</hi> as alſo the chamfered bodies, which we deſcribed before, are all lacking: and beſides, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain it ſelf is figured after another manner. That theſe may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be beheld, make the diſſection of the brain of a Gooſe or a Turky-Cock; and the Membranes being cut off, by preſſing lightly the fiſſure or cleft of the brain, you may divide the middle of it one from another, and go forward to ſeparate it, till you come to its boſom, in which place are two marrowy bodies, which being ſtretched out like Nerves, connect the Hemiſpheres one to another. Either ſide of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitium</hi> or the ſpace between, is clothed with a whitiſh Membrane, which is marked with ſtreaks or beams, lying or running from the whole compaſs or circumference, to the lower corner; and theſe ſtreaks concenter about the inſertions of the medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary bodies. Then, if this Membrane be cut, in either Hemiſphere of the brain, there will appear underneath a cavity, which goes under the whole ſpace, from the ſide of the <hi>Interſtitium,</hi> and for a great part, the hinder region of the brain, and is arched or chambered with that ſtreaked Membrane. Either cavity or hollowneſs, about the bottom, is opened into an intermediate or common paſſage, which lies open to the Tunnel; and from either ſide of this paſſage the ſhanks of the oblong marrow are ſtretched out, to which, on either ſide, the Hemiſphere of the brain is hung by two medullary bodies; to wit, one marrowy or medullary body goes out from the mole or ſubſtance of the brain lying under the Ventricle, the other from the ſtreaked Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane covering the Ventricle. From theſe two, placed on either ſide, the medullary bodies being ſtretched out croſs-wiſe, like Nerves, joyn the two Hemiſpheres of the brain to one another. Beſides, theſe two growing together on either ſide, fix either Hemiſphere of the brain to the ſhanks of the oblong marrow.</p>
                     <p>So the figure of the Brain in Fowl, if you compare it with the brain in men and of the more perfect four-footed beaſts, ſeems to be as it were inverſed. For as in theſe the Cortical part is outward, and the medullary laid under it; ſo in Fowls, the lower frame of the brain, which conſiſts of a thick and cloſer ſubſtance, is inſtead of the <hi>Cortex</hi> or ſhell; but the outmoſt and upper Membrane, chambering the Ventricle, appears medullar or marrowy above any other part. Moreover, the Ventricles in the brains of a man and four-footed beaſts are placed beneath, and near the bottom; in Fowls, above and nigh the outward border. The reaſon of this difference ſeems to be, becauſe in a more perfect brain, ſuch as is in man and four footed beaſts, the animal Spirits have both their birth and exerciſe; <hi>viz.</hi> they are procreated in its Cortical or ſhelly part, and in its medullary, which being large enough, lyes under this, they are circulated and variouſly expanded for the acting of their faculties. But truly in the brain of Fowls there is ſpace enough for the generation of Spirits, but for their circulation there is ſcarce any left: to wit, the brains of Birds ſeem not to be much poſſeſſed with the gifts of phantaſie or memory: yea it is thought, that the Spirits begotten in the brain are exerciſed chiefly in the oblong marrow for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the animal function; for there, as we ſhall ſhew anon, the medullary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is inſtead of the callous body, conſiſts; and like the ſtreaked bodies in others, in theſe are ſtreaked Membranes, through which the Spirits, procreated in the brain, are carried, without any order there, forthwith into the oblong mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but becauſe the Spirits, begot in the brain, ought to lay aſide a ſerous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore the Ventricles, from the complicature of the ſtreaked Membrane upon the keel or lower part of the brain, and on the ſhanks of the oblong marrow it ſelf, do ſerve conveniently enough for this buſineſs. Notwithſtanding, becauſe in the brains of Fowls, the <hi>Fornix</hi> is wholly wanting, there are only two anterior Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles; between which, the Choroeides infolding is ſtretched out; the veinous portion whereof, as was but now ſaid, ariſes a little lower from the fourth boſom; but the Arteries aſcending, come from either ſide of the oblong marrow.</p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107014:63"/>
                     <p>Nor is there a greater heterogeneity or difference of conformation in the Brain it ſelf of Fowls, than in the oblong marrow from the ſame in men and four-footed beaſts. For in the firſt Section, from whence the Optick Nerves ariſe, two noted protuberances grow to either ſide. Theſe are much greater in proportion than the orbicular prominences in the more perfect Creatures; ſo that they ſeem another additional brain: either of them of a white colour, and purely marrowy, is hollow within; ſo that in theſe kind of Animals are found two bellies or Ventricles in the brain, and as many in the oblong marrow. And ſeeing in theſe, as in all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, a cavity is put under the Cerebel, the Ventricles in the whole Head differ as well in number as in figure and poſition.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the medullary Trunk, to wit, where thoſe prominences grow to its ſides, the Chink, leading to the Tunnel, is cut, but into it the aperture of either Ventricle gapes or opens, that it is not to be doubted, but that the ſeroſities heaped up there, are ſent out by that way. Moreover it is likely, that theſe hollow and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary prominences in Fowls ſupply the courſe of the callous body, to wit, in which the animal Spirits are circulated for the exerciſing their faculties: becauſe in the brain the ſpace is ſo narrow, that the Spirits cannot be produced and circulated together within its confines. Further, as in Fowls, the uſe of the animal Spirits is required for the act of the ſenſitive and loco-motive faculty, more than for phantaſie or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; certainly the chief place where they may meet and be exerciſed, ought to be placed rather in the oblong marrow than in the brain.</p>
                     <p>The Carotidick Arteries, which carry the blood to the brains of the greater Birds, are ſo ſmall, that there is no proportion of theſe to the ſame in man and four-footed beaſts. Their Trunks being carried within the Skull, aſcend without any branchings into net-like infoldings, alter the ſame manner as in other Animals, nigh to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitary Glandula, and paſs right into the brain, and diſtribute ſome ſmall ſhoots of the Veſſels both to its exterior compaſs, and through its inward receſſes. But in truth, the brains of Birds are watered with a very ſmall portion of blood, in reſpect of other living Creatures; becauſe, where the fancy or imagination is little exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is not much blood required for the refreſhing the animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Fowl (otherwiſe than ſome affirm) have both the mammillary proceſſes, and the Cribrous or Sieve-like bone. For the anterior productions of the brain being highly extenuated and involved with the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> ſtretching out almoſt to the middle part of the bill, are inſerted into the triangular bone, which hath a double boſom, diſtinguiſhed between with a thin mound or pale. But theſe proceſſes being dilated within the boſom of the aforeſaid bone, and in Bladders full of clear water, which are very like the mammillary proceſſes in a Calf, full of clear water. Beſides, as out of the fifth pair of Nerves, a noted branch on either ſide paſſing through the ball of the Eye, enters into the cavern of the Noſtril, a ſhoot of it being ſent out of the Trunk, is beſtowed to the very orifice of the Noſtrils; in the mean time, both the greater Trunks, compaſſing about the Cribrous bone, meet together, and preſently going one from the other, and being carried to the end of the bill, are diſtributed into the palate. After this manner Fowls, even as men and four-footed beaſts, are furniſhed with a peculiar organ of ſmelling, to wit, with a double mammillary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and beſides, they have within the Noſtrils additional Nerves out of the fifth pair, by whoſe action and communication of branches into other parts, and among themſelves, ſo ſtrict an affinity is contracted between the ſmell and the taſte. The other pairs of Nerves are almoſt after the ſame manner as in men and four-footed beaſts. In like manner we alſo obſerve, that there is no great difference as to the Cerebel and the other portion of the oblong marrow, between Birds and the other Animals we have already conſidered on, unleſs that the orbicular prominences before the Cerebel, and the other annulary under it, meeting within them, are both wanting in Fowls; indeed theſe latter ſeem not at all to be required; but inſtead of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they are eaſily ſupplied from the hollow medullary prominences, ſuch as we have ſhewn to be in Fowls.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are what are chiefly worth noting to be found in the brains of Fowls. We have already mentioned, that there is a certain likeneſs between theſe and Fiſhes as to the moſt parts of the head: wherefore it will ſeem to be to the purpoſe, that here for a concluſion we ſhould ſay ſomething of the brain of Fiſhes. Firſt, we ſhall obſerve, that as the heads of Fiſhes, in reſpect of the whole body, are greater than of any other living Creatures, yet they contain in them leſs brain than others. For
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107014:63"/>two little moles or ſubſtances, placed before, ſuſtain the whole place of the brain, properly ſo called; out of theſe, two ſignal ſmelling Nerves proceed, which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a long and ſtraight journey to the holes made hollow, out of either ſide of the mouth, and which are inſtead of noſtrils: and this is ſingular to Fiſhes. Moreover, we advertiſe concerning the Optick Nerves, that they, as in other living Creatures, inclining mutually one to the other, are not however united, unleſs perhaps towards the ſuperficies; but they are croſſed, and a Nerve ariſing from the right ſide of the oblong marrow, is carried into the left Eye, and ſo on the contrary: ſo indeed, that the viſory rays have their refraction, not only in the Eye, but within the very bodies of the Nerves. The oblong marrow in Fiſhes, wholly after the like manner as in Birds, hath two ſignal protuberances hollowed within; and in truth, as to local motions, the Spirits in either ſeem to the exerciſed after the like mode. For as Fiſhes ſwim in the water, ſo the flying of Fowls or Birds ſeems a certain kind of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Air. Further, in theſe 'tis obſervable, there are the pituitary Kernel, the Tunnel, and the Carotidick Arteries as in other Animals; alſo many pairs of the Nerves have the ſame origines and diſtributions, excepting that the hearing Nerves are here wanting; although <hi>Caſſerus Placentinus</hi> attributes this gift to the ſmelling Nerves. The figure of the Cerebel is the ſame as in more perfect Animals. Beſides, what we have remarked concerning the wandring pair of Nerves in man and four-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beaſts; to wit, many fibres of it ariſing together, the trunk of the Nerve from the ſpinal marrow comes to them: in like manner the ſame is in Fiſhes. But to deſcribe them all further is needleſs: for the reſt, as thoſe which are proper to them only and Birds, as alſo thoſe which they have common with Fowls and the more perfect Animals, may be eaſily known, partly out of the peculiar ſimilitude with birds, and partly out of the univerſal Analogy of all. Therefore we will now philoſophiſe upon the Uſe and Action of the Brain and its Parts, and of its Appendix, together with the whole oeconomy of the animal Function: where in the firſt place, we will inquire into the offices of a more perfect Brain, ſuch as of man and four-footed beaſts; and alſo ſecondarily and collaterally we ſhall explain the Offices and Actions of a leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Brain, and of its Parts, ſuch as that of Fowls and Fiſhes.</p>

                     <p>THE Poets feigned <hi>Pallas</hi> to be formed within the Brain of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and from thence to be born. In truth, within the Womb of the Brain all the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ideas, Forces, and Powers whatſoever both of the Rational and Senſitive Soul are framed; and having there gotten a ſpecies and form, are produced into act. Wherefore it will be worth our labour to inquire into theſe places, of the generation of theſe more noble faculties, and the firſt riſe and primitive beginnings of them, as alſo more curiouſly to conſider the divers parts of the Brain, or the Organs ſerving to their Generation: And I go about this part of my labour the more willingly, that I may by handling the thread of our diſſection again, bring all the Phaenomena, before given to our inſpection and ſenſe, before the Eye of Reaſon, and to be again weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a more ſevere Examination of Diſcourſe; at leaſt thoſe things which ſeem to be of the greater moment, and chiefly worth taking notice of. Neither do we think here to heap up into a great Volume the ſeveral things worn out by the handling of others, and offered to common obſervation.</p>
                     <p>Therefore recollecting the Anatomy of the Brain, the firſt things to be conſidered are its coverings, to wit, the Skull, and the two Meninxes or Maters. Concerning the firſt it is obſerved, that all perfect Animals have an hard and bony Skull. A dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon for which may be given: Firſt, that the Head being deſtinated for the moſt noble uſe, might be protected with a more firm and not eaſily penetrable covering, as a natural Helmet, againſt the injuries of external ſtrokes; beſides ſecondly, as this is in the place of Armor, ſo alſo of a Cloiſter; becauſe the ſame covering the <hi>dura Mater</hi> within, may reſtrain and keep within the Brain the Effluvia's of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107014:64"/>Spirits, leſt they ſhould too thickly evaporate, or in heaps. Further, as the Skull for theſe ends is made bony, the efficient cauſe are the ſaline Particles of the blood watering the brain, which being unprofitable to the interior work of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and ſo to be ſent away outwardly, grow together thus in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and are congealed into a ſtony hardneſs: For indeed the blood being carried towards the Head, as it abounds very much in Spirit, ſo in Salt; its Particles highly volatile, being joyned to the Spirits, are beſtowed on the brain; in the mean time, the ſaline little bodies, which are of a more fixed nature, being thruſt out into the circumference, from the Spirit implanted in the Brain, conſtitute the ſtony Skull, as it were a bubble covering incloſed wind.</p>
                     <p>Within the hollow ſuperficies of the Skull, there appear many furrows and inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities imprinted by the protuberances of the Veſſels; and we perceive frequently either border or plate of it to be perforated by the paſſing through of the Veſſels in ſeveral places: but the Arteries, ariſing in the exterior ſuperficies of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> make theſe kind of little ditches through the concavity of the Skull. For when the whole ſubſtance of the brain is at firſt ſoft, and eaſily giving place, like Wax; the Arteries underneath it continually beating, as it hardens by degrees, eaſily imprint the marks of their tracts.</p>
                     <p>The figure of the Skull in four footed beaſts is narrow and preſt down, but in man, the ſubſtance of whoſe brain is large, there is required a more capacious and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpherical figure. For as God gave him an upright countenance to behold the Heavens, and alſo endued his brain with an immortal Soul, and fitted for the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Heaven; therefore his face is erect or lifted up: ſo the brain it ſelf is placed in a more eminent place, to wit, above the Cerebel and all the Senſories. But in Brutes, and ſuch whoſe faces are prone towards the Earth, and have a brain unfit for ſpeculation, the Cerebel, however ſerving to the more noted action and office of the Praecordia, is placed in the higheſt ſeat to which the mole of the brain is ſubjected. Beſides, ſome organs of the Senſes, to wit, the Ears and Eyes, if they be not ſuperior, they are placed at leaſt equal to the brain. In an humane Head, the Baſis of the Brain and Cerebel being placed nigh together, yea of the whole Skull, is made parallel to the Horizon; whereby it comes to paſs, that there is leſs danger for any portion of the Head to be jogged here and there, or to be moved out of its proper ſeat: But in four-footed beaſts, who go with an hanging down head, the Baſis of the Skull makes a right angle with the Horizon; wherefore the brain being ſubjected, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel is put in the higheſt place; ſo indeed, that this ſeems leſs ſtable, and that it may ſhake, or be moved from its ſeat. However againſt this inconvenience, leſt a frequent concuſſion of the Cerebel might induce a ſinking down or loſs of the Spirits, or irregularities about the Praecordia, in ſome it is taken care of by a wonderful arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Nature; for as in all the frame or ſubſtance of the Cerebel is moſt ſtrictly bound faſt together by the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> beſides in ſome it is ſtaid by a bony fence; but in others, as in a Hare, Rabbet, and other leſſer Brutes, a certain portion of the Cerebel is included on either ſide by a ſtony bone, and ſo by this double hold its whole bulk or ſubſtance is firmly tyed to the Skull. Concerning the chief bones of the Skull, <hi>viz:</hi> the Cuniform or Wedge-like bone, the Cribrous or Sieve-like bone, and the auditory or hearing Organ, they ſhall be ſpoken of in their proper places, when we come to treat particularly of the Ventricles of the Brain, and of the Senſes to which theſe bones ſerve. We ſhall paſs next to the hard <hi>Meninx</hi> or <hi>dura Mater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>dura Mater</hi> or hard Meninx, formed of a double kind of Veſſels and Proceſſes, bears alſo a double Aſpect, and owes part of its office to the Skull, that is about it, and part to the <hi>Encephalon</hi> contained within it. The exterior proceſſes of this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane are inſinuated within all the boſoms and cavities of the Skull; to ſome whereof they are a covering and defence, but to others they impart a ſenſible force; which manifeſtly appears in the Sieve-like bone, through whoſe holes the fringes of this Membrane paſſing, conduce ſomething to the ſenſe of ſmelling. Alſo the productions of this, lying over the receſſes and caverns of the Wedge-like bone, fortifie the ways for the entrance and coming out of the Veſſels. The interior proceſſes of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> which belong to the Head, divide and diſtinguiſh between the parts of the brain and Cerebel; and in thoſe places the <hi>dura Mater</hi> is very thick, leſt in any great concuſſion of the Head, theſe two ſhould be ſmitten one againſt another, and ſhould preſs one upon the other. Wherefore in Dogs (as we have already hinted) who are wont to run violently with their heads down, there is ſent down between theſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107014:64"/>bodies a bony fence. In like manner in a Cat, Horſe, Fox, and many other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, from whoſe manner of living and uſe it is required, that they be moved with a ſwift motion, that bony fence, commonly called the Triangular Bone, is ſent down deeply between the Brain and the Cerebel; yea, and all the boſoms paſs through that bone in the holes curiouſly made hollow in it.</p>
                     <p>The Veſſels belonging to the <hi>dura Mater</hi> are either Arteries, that carry the blood thither; or they are Veins, which receiving from thence the ſuperfluous blood, and from the whole Head beſides, return it towards the Heart. As to the firſt ſort of Veſſels, on either ſide, two Arteries ariſing from the Carotidick Artery on the ſame ſide, before it comes to the Baſis of the Brain, are carried into the <hi>dura Mater:</hi> which notwithſtanding, only poſſeſſing the exterior ſuperficies or convex part, carry blood and juyce to this Membrane, alſo in ſome meaſure to the Skull and its cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. As to the Veſſels carrying the blood back, this Meninx contains four, into which, as into a great Sea, all the Rivulets of the Arteries, ſerving the whole Head, do exonerate themſelves: to wit, there are obſerved in this Membrane four noted Cavities, commonly called Boſoms; which are diſpoſed after that manner, that, like Promptuaries or Store-houſes framed in ſeveral places, they receive the blood return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from every region and corner of the brain: For the third boſom, or the longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, looks towards the anterior brain, the fourth towards its middle; but the firſt and ſecond admit the blood flowing back from the Cerebel and hinder part of the brain. Further, out of theſe the third and fourth disburden themſelves into the firſt and ſecond; and theſe at length transfer their burden into the Jugular Veins. On every ſide, from theſe boſoms, the leſſer Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the chanels of the Veins are ſent forth, which going out night the interior or concave ſuperficies of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> are preſently inſerted into the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and following its protenſion, being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the whole compaſs, and all the interior receſſes of the brain and its Appendix within the Skull, and being complicated with the Arteries, receive the ſuperfluous blood, and carry it into thoſe greater cavities. That it is ſo, it plainly appears, becauſe if you ſquirt a liquor, dyed with ink, into the Pipe of the Artery, that paſſing through the arterious ſhoots, and then the veinous, goes through at laſt into the boſoms.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the blood, returning from the whole interior Head, is collected within thoſe boſoms, as with a full belly, it ſeems alſo in another reſpect to be of a very notable uſe; to wit, for the ſupplying of heat, requiſite for the diſtilling forth of the animal Spirits, as if it were a certain Chymical operation. For as much as the blood to be diſtilled, is contained in the Veſſels, interwoven into the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Rivers diffuſed on every ſide through the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> the heat being brought to it like a <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> flow about the underlying blood, and ſo force out of it a moſt ſubtil Liquor into the ſubſtance of the Brain; or rather, the blood raiſing up heat within the boſoms, is like the fire of ſuppreſſion, which in the diſtillation by deſcent, is inkindled round about the Veſſel containing the matter to be diſtilled. For indeed the interior ſubſtance of the Brain, for that it is endued with plenty of Salt and very little Sulphur, is of a more frigid temper: wherefore, that from the blood watering its ſuperficies, the ſpirituous part may be ſtilled forth, and forced into its middle or marrow, the degree of the ambient heat ought to be made the more ſtrong, ſuch indeed, as the blood collected in the ample Eſtuaries of the boſoms, may eaſily afford. Further, as thoſe boſoms being diſtended with heated blood, are like a certain diſtillatory Bath; ſo the other Membrane of the <hi>dura Mater</hi> being ſtretched out about the whole Head, is like an impervious Alembick, which with its covering keeps within the ſpirituous breaths, that they may not be immoderately evaporated.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Membrane there may yet be conſidered, with what motion or ſenſe it is endued. And as to ſenſe, 'tis not to be doubted, but that it hath it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely: For ſince all the Membranes have feeling, and owe that faculty to the afflux of the animal Spirits from the Brain, ſurely this Meninx, for that it is nearer and very much of kin to the Brain and its Appendix, ſo that it clothes very many Nerves going out of the Skull, it obtains a very accurate virtue of feeling: which thing alſo may be argued from the effect; becauſe the pains of the Head often proceed from the breach of unity excited in this Membrane. But that it hath motion, it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought, becauſe it is tyed in very many places to the Skull; and yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the ſame may ſometimes, in ſome parts at leaſt, be contracted and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107014:65"/>or drawn together: And certainly there is no doubt, that it is contracted and remitted in ſneeling. In like manner, when from an hurt of this a Vomiting or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions follow in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or Members, this Membrane is the cauſe, which being ſomewhere contracted or divided, infolds with it ſelf the ſubſtance contained within with the ſame Convulſion or Spaſm.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the motion of this Membrane, a curious mind may yet further conſider its texture, and eſpecially how it is within the cavities of the boſoms, and the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitium</hi> or ſeparation of the Brain and Cerebel. For in theſe places are found many Fibres, or as it were greater or nervous cords or ſtrings, ſuch as we have obſerved to be variouſly ſtretched out in the Ventricles of the Heart. Within the boſoms, from the various proceſſes of the Membrane, a cavity full of turnings and windings, and manifoldly divided, as it were with many little Cells, is conſtituted. This ſeems to be thus made, to this end, to wit, that the blood returning back from divers little rivers into the cavities of the boſoms, may be retarded by ſeveral obſtacles, as it were little flood-gates; leſt perhaps ruſhing too impetuouſly and by heaps, it might flow within this Sea with a vertiginous and inordinate motion. But there is obſerved, beſides theſe intrications and little cells of this Meninx in the heads of four-footed beaſts, that moreover in the whole cavity of the boſoms, very many cords, as it were Ligaments, are every where produced from one ſide to the other. The office of theſe is partly, that they may contain the ſides of the cavity within their due ends of aperture and dilation, leſt they ſhould be diſtended above meaſure by the vehement ruſhing in of the blood, and ſo may preſs upon the ſubſtance of the brain. Yea the contexture of theſe whitiſh Fibres, which are met with, both within the cavities of the boſoms, and in this Meninx, going about the Cerebel, and diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Brain, ſeems to intimate, that they ſerve alſo to ſome motion. For it may be ſuſpected, that thoſe ſtrong Fibres, and as it were Ligaments, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contract, ſometimes dilate, and variouſly draw the Membrane to which they are knit. From theſe kind of motions of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> the blood flowing within the boſoms, may be variouſly agitated, and as occaſion ſerves, ſometimes haſtened in its Circle, and ſometimes reſtrained or hindred; for in many affections of the ſenſitive Soul, the blood being diſturbed from its equal circulation, is ſometimes precipitated by heaps and impetuouſly to the Heart, and ſometimes detained from its neſt longer, nigh the confines of the Brain. But that various whirlwinds of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſtir up ſuch irregularities in the motion of the blood, the nervous parts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are in ſome meaſure the cauſe, which by contracting or dilating the ſame, variouſly moderate the courſe of the blood; yet ſo, that in the mean time, ſome part of this office is due from the brain it ſelf, or at leaſt to its Appendix. Indeed the brain it ſelf wants motion; but the blood paſſing through its ſubſtance, for as much as it is poured wholly in this Meninx, and paſſes through its receptacles, is at the motion and beck of this Membrane, ſometimes driven away from the brain, and commanded to ſuccour the Heart, as in fear and great ſadneſs, ſometimes being haſtened towards the brain, is for ſome time prohibited from flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, as in ſhame, indignation, and ſome other affections.</p>
                     <p>Truly, that theſe kind of interior proceſſes of the boſoms, and as it were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſtrings or cords, do conduce to the more commodious reduction of the blood, we gather alſo from hence, that in working beaſts, whoſe brain (becauſe they feed and go with a prone and hanging down head) is in greater danger of an inundation of the blood, thoſe proceſſes are very big, for that they being ſucceſſively contracted, may leiſurely thruſt out the blood, apt otherwiſe to ſtagnate by reaſon of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the head. Neither is it from the purpoſe to obſerve here, that theſe ſame Animals are always furniſhed, for that reaſon, with a greater wonderful Net: by which means indeed it is provided, that the blood may not too much invade the brain by heaps; as care is taken by the artifice but now deſcribed, leſt the ſame ſhould make too long ſtay in the brain, and ſo oppreſs its more weak frame.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the laſt place, that I may recollect what I have ſaid of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> and rehearſe its chief uſes: Firſt, It covers over the Skull within, and reaches to it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of nouriſhment by the Veſſels. Secondly, It is a covering to the whole head, and ſerves to diſtinguiſh its chief parts. Thirdly, It contains the Veſſels deſigned for the reducing the blood from the whole interior head; which, in the mean time, by reaſon of the plenty of the blood contained in them, and the opportunity of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adminiſter requiſite heat for the diſtillation of the Spirits. Fourthly, It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107014:65"/>ways for the admiſſion and going out of all the Veſſels within the Skull, and fortifies them; to which may be added, that it beſtows on ſome of them their Coats, as ſhall be ſhewn anon. Fifthly and laſtly, This Meninx being here and there contracted or divided by the animal Spirits variouſly moved, according to the paſſions of the Soul, or the neceſſities of Nature, ſtays the blood ſometimes longer near the confines of the Brain, ſometimes drives it forward from thence towards the <hi>Praecordia.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE interior <hi>Meninx</hi> or <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is far thinner than the exterior, and conſiſts of a moſt ſubtle contexture of Fibres. This does not compaſs about the <hi>Encephalon</hi>'s ſuperficies as looſly as the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> but embraces it ſo very ſtrictly, that it is very hardly ſeparated from it: beſides, it inſinuates it ſelf into all its turnings and windings and furrows, and clothes their inward parts. Further, this <hi>Meninx,</hi> although it be thin, yet being covered over throughout with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings of Arteries and Veins, is interwoven with them, and ſo waters all the ſpaces of the Brain and Cerebel with innumerable rivers. For as the Region of either of theſe, eſpecially of the Brain, is full of turnings and windings, this Membrane in like manner grows to the deep furrows of the crankling turnings about, and alſo to the tops of the ridges; yea, the chief complications of the Veſſels are ſtill placed in the vallies, as if they were there hid in regard of their ſafety. Neither doth this <hi>Meninx</hi> only cover the gapings of the turnings and windings about; but alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers together the tops or heights of all their interſtices or places between, and knits them together, and ſo makes the whole ſuperficies of the Head plain, globous, and as it were like the World.</p>
                     <p>That the diffuſion of this wonderful Membrane into all the turnings and windings of the Brain, and the diſtribution of the Veſſels through thoſe moſt intimate receſſes, may be the better beheld; let the head of a man, or of a brute beaſt that dyed of the Dropſie, be opened: For in ſuch, whoſe brain abounds with much moiſture, the little ſtays, whereby this Meninx is fixed to the ſubſtance of the brain, are looſned, ſo that the Membrane, with the infoldings of the Veſſels, may be eaſily drawn away, and pulled off almoſt whole: which indeed being pulled off, the folds of the brain will appear naked; alſo the inſertions of the Veſſels every where into the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubſtance of the brain, may be perceived. But to a ſound and dry brain the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> ſticks ſo cloſely, that it can ſcarce be drawn away in any part, or ſeparated with a Penknife.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſhewn after what manner the Veins and Arteries (which creeping like Ivy, are knit into the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and variouſly interwoven into it) cover over with moſt thick little ſhoots, the whole compaſs of the Brain and Cerebel, and their Interſtices, the gapings of the crankling turnings and windings about, boſoms, and cavities, and ſend forth every where ſmall ſhoots into the medullary ſubſtance; ſo that it is not to be doubted, but that the animal Spirits, being as it were ſtilled forth immediately from the blood, every where in the whole head, are received into the Pores and paſſages of the Brain and Cerebel. From hence it will be eaſie to aſſign the uſe or office of the <hi>Pia Mater: viz.</hi> Firſt, this Membrane clothes the univerſal parts of the whole <hi>Encephalon,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes them all one from another. For indeed, this lying over all the gapings and interſtices of the turnings and windings, is inſtead of a mound or fence, by which the animal Spirits are reſtrained every where within their proper cells and orbs of expanſion, nor are they permitted by this means to run beyond their bounds, and ſo confound the acts of the many Faculties. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this Meninx ſuſtains all the blood carrying Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> both the Arteries and Veins, together with their manifold productions, and ſo affords a paſſage to the blood, by carrying it to and fro towards the brain.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe Veſſels, which are knit to this Meninx, and follow its ſtretching
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107014:66"/>out into all parts, there are many admirable things to be met with, and highly worthy of note, the uſes and reaſons of which is our purpoſe to ſearch into.</p>
                     <p>As to theſe, we ſhall firſt obſerve, that theſe Arteries and Veins, otherwiſe than in any other part of the body beſides, not ariſing nigh one another go forth as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but going forth from oppoſite ends, meet every where mutually, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arteries aſcend from the Baſis of the Skull, and by creeping through the whole, emit upwards ſhoots and branches, which are met by the Pipes of the Veins ariſing out of the boſoms, and carried downwards. By this means the rivers of the blood ſeem to be made equal every where in the Brain, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the ſmaller ſhoots of the Veins follow or match the greater branches of the Arteries, and on the contrary, the ſmall branches of the Arteries the Trunks of the Veins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We have already ſhewn, that theſe Veſſels are variouſly and very much ingrafted or inoculated among themſelves, not only the Arteries with the Veins, but what is more rare and ſingular, Arteries with Arteries; to wit, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidick Arteries of one ſide, in many places, are united with the Carotides of the other ſide; beſides the Vertebrals of either ſide among themſelves, and are alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated into the poſterior branches of the Carotides before united. The joynings together of the Carotides, in moſt living Creatures, are made about the Baſis of the Skull under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and that after a diverſe manner; in ſome communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Veſſels of the wonderful Net from one ſide to the other; in others (as in a Horſe we have obſerved with a certain admiration) the arterious chanel is produced between the Trunks of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> whereby the blood may be carried from one ſide to the other, and ſo on the contrary. But beſides, between the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> about the Baſis of the Head, the ſame kind of ingraftings of the Arteries are ſtill ſeen in man and all perfect four-footed beaſts.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of theſe ſeems to be partly, that the blood to be carried from the Heart into divers Regions of the Brain, might be exactly mingled as to its parts and particles, before it come to the place deſigned. For the Torrent of the blood, becauſe divided into leſſer rivulets, is incident to languiſh in ſo long a circuit, and its Spirits to be depauperated, and laſtly it ſelf to grow cool; unleſs that various courſes of its <hi>Latex</hi> ſhould anew inkindle this vital flame about to be extinguiſhed or dye.</p>
                     <p>But there is another reaſon far greater than this of theſe manifold ingraftings of the Veſſels, to wit, that there may be a manifold way, and that more certain, for the blood about to go into divers Regions of the Brain, laid open for each; ſo that if by chance one or two ſhould be ſtopt, there might eaſily be ſound another paſſage inſtead of them: as for example, if the <hi>Carotides</hi> of one ſide ſhould be obſtructed, then the Veſſels of the other ſide might provide for either Province. Alſo as to the <hi>Vertebral</hi> Arteries, there is the ſame manner of proviſion made. Further, if both the <hi>Carotides</hi> ſhould be ſtopped, the offices of each might be ſupplied through the <hi>Vertebrals,</hi> and ſo on the other ſide the <hi>Carotides</hi> may ſupply the defects of the ſhut up <hi>Vertebrals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this manner, leſt there ſhould be wanting an afflux of the blood at any time in any part of the Brain, or its Appendix, within the Skull, there is care taken with ſingular Art: For as there are four diſtinct paſſages, and thoſe remote one from the other, of this <hi>Latex,</hi> if perchance three of them ſhould happen to be ſhut up, the blood being carried through one only, will ſoon ſupply or fill the chanels and paſſages of all the reſt. Which thing I have found by Experience often tryed, not without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and great pleaſure. To wit, I have ſquirted oftentimes into either Artery of the Carotides, a liquor dyed with Ink, and preſently the branches on either ſide, yea and the chief ſhoots of the Vertebrals, have been dyed with the ſame tincture: yea, if ſuch an injection be ſometimes iterated by one only paſſage, the Veſſels creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every corner and ſecret place of the Brain and Cerebel, will be imbued with the ſame colour. Alſo in thoſe who have the wonderful Net, the Tincture or dyed Liquor being injected in one ſide, it will come through the Net like infoldings of the Veſſels in both ſides. Hence it plainly appears, that there is a communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Veſſels watering the whole Head; and although every Artery is carried to one only Region, as its peculiar Province, and provides for it apart; yet, leſt that any part ſhould be deprived of the influence of the blood, more ways lye open to every part by the ingraftings of thoſe veſſels; ſo that if the proper veſſels by chance ſhould be wanting in their office, its defect may preſently be compenſated by others neighbouring.</p>

When his Skull was opened, we beheld thoſe things belonging to the Head, and found the right <hi>Carotides,</hi> riſing within the Skull, plainly bony or rather ſtony, its cavity being almoſt wholly ſhut up; ſo that the influx of the blood being denied to this paſſage, it ſeemed wonderful, wherefore this ſick perſon had not dyed before of an <hi>Apoplexy:</hi> which indeed he was ſo far from, that he enjoyed to the laſt moment of his life, the free exerciſe of his mind and animal function. For indeed, Nature had ſubſtituted a ſufficient Remedy againſt that danger of an <hi>Apoplexy;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Vertebral</hi> Artery of the ſame ſide, in which the Carotidick was wanting, the bulk of the Pipe being enlarged, became thrice as big as both its Pipes on the other ſide: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the blood being excluded the Carotidick, adding it ſelf to the wonted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Vertebral Artery, and flowing with a double flood into the ſame belly, had ſo dilated the chanel of that Artery above meaſure. This Gentleman, about the beginning of his ſickneſs, was tormented with a cruel pain of the Head towards the left ſide. The cauſe whereof cannot be more probably aſſigned, than that the blood excluded from the right Carotidick Artery, when at firſt it ruſhed more impetuouſly in the left, had diſtended the Membrane; and therefore the ſame diſtemper did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vaniſh of its own accord, to wit, the ſuperfluous blood being derived through the Vertebral Artery.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Concerning theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels covering the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Arteries and Veins, whilſt they meet one another, going out from oppoſite ends, do not only transfer their burden immediately through the ſeveral branches or ſhoots, mutually ingrafted, as is wont to be done in other parts of the Body; but being variouſly complicated and interwoven, do conſtitute every where admirable infoldings, into which, for the moſt part, very ſmall and very numerous Glandula's or Kernels are inſerted. Which thing is ſeen, not only in the infoldings, which are called <hi>Choroeides,</hi> (by which name, beſides thoſe which are found within the plicature or folding up of the Brain, we alſo intend others planted together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Cerebel) but theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels, with Glandula's ſowed between, are ſeen every where to be ſprinkled through the whole compaſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior receſſes of the Brain and Cerebel, and eſpecially between the gapings of their turnings and windings and interſtices. This is clearly manifeſt in a moiſter Brain, or in an Hydropical, where the very ſmall Glandula's, which otherwiſe are ſcarce to be ſeen, being intumified by the moiſture, are eaſily beheld. Moreover, from the aforeſaid infoldings, on every ſide implanted, little ſlender Veſſels, being every where ſent forth, enter the Cortical, and in ſome meaſure the medullary ſubſtance of the Brain and its Appendix; for if you ſquirt into the <hi>Carotides</hi> a black liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſhoots of the Veſſels, which it dyes every where with the ſame colour, little blackiſh pricks will appear ſprinkled in the ſubſtance of the Brain. Further, if the brain of a living Animal be cut up, the live blood will ſpring forth both from its <hi>Cortex</hi> and medullary part. The reaſon and end of all which, if they be inquired into, it ſeems that theſe foldings of the Veſſels, being variouſly complicated with repeated windings about, as if they were little ſerpentine chanels hanging to an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, through whoſe narrow ſtraits the blood paſſing with a long circuit, becomes ſtill more ſubtil and elaborated; to wit, its thicker part, being by degrees put off in its paſſage, or ſent away by the little branches of the Veins, and ſo at length the only pure and moſt ſpirituous blood, and it ſelf now ready to go into animal Spirits, is admitted within the Pores and paſſages of the brain. But as the blood or ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolent part is ſupped up by the Veins, ſo it's very likely the Serum or watry part is received by the Glandula's or Kernels interwoven in them. For it appears not for what other end theſe Arteries are every where beſet with ſo many Kernels, unleſs they ſhould lay up in them the ſuperfluous ſeroſities. Between theſe infoldings there appear not any Nerves to be found, which may require any juyce or ſerous humor from theſe Kernels; and 'tis not yet found, whether theſe Lymphaeducts or Water-carriers be accompanied with any Veſſel: wherefore it may be lawful to ſuppoſe, that whilſt the purer and ſpirituous part of the blood, being ſeparated from the reſt of its maſs, is ſtilled forth into the brain, the ſerous humidities are received by the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's, which are numerous, and that they are for ſome time retained by them, till they may be ſent away into the Veins growing empty again.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have beheld only the ſuperior branchings forth of the blood-carrying Veſſels, which are every where interwoven in the <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> and their infoldings,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107014:67"/>which like the leaves of a Wood, or creeping Ivy, cover the exterior compaſs of the whole Head. But by what means, and as it were Chymical Artifice, theſe Veſſels do inſtil the animal Spirits into the Brain and Cerebel, and ſerve for the uſe of one another beſides, ſhall be told anon, after we have conſidered of the inferior Aſpect and next the ground of this moſt thick Wood, <hi>viz.</hi> the greater Trunks of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which are deſtinated for the Brain, where they paſs through the Skull, and ſhew themſelves beyond it.</p>

                           <hi>Shews with what difference the Arteries in various Animals paſsthrough the Skull; alſo for what uſe the wonderful Net is made, and the reaſon of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Arteries, deſtinated to the Brain, are four in number, <hi>viz.</hi> two <hi>Carotides,</hi> and as many <hi>Vertebrals.</hi> Concerning the former, we have already obſerved, that their Trunks paſs through the Wedge-like Bone, as it were with a mechanical proviſion; to wit, either Artery is ſo bowed and intorted in its aſcent, that the blood, before it can reach to the Brain by a repeated ſtopping of ſhores, or hindred by a certain lett or impediment, might flow to it leſs rapidly and more ſlowly. But this is not effected after one and the ſame manner in all Animals: for although the aſcent of the Artery be oblique and intorted in all, yet in ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> in a Man and a Horſe, it being bowed about with a greater compaſs, ſtill enters, even to the Brain, with a ſingle and undivided Trunk: when in moſt other beaſts the ſame paſſes the Skull with a leſſer circuit, and ſliding preſently under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> diverſifies it ſelf there into Retiform infoldings, commonly called the wonderful Net. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems to be to the purpoſe, that we inquire into the various reaſons of this difference.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore we ſhall advertiſe you, that the Carotidick Artery in a man enters a little more backward the Skull, than in any other Animal, <hi>viz.</hi> nigh that hole through which the lateral boſom ſlides out of the Skull about to be implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Jugular Vein; for in the reſt, this Artery ariſes within the Skull under the end or acute proceſs of the ſtony Bone. But in an humane Head, the ſame being carried about by a longer compaſs, (that the Torrent of the blood, before it comes to the border of the Brain, might flow ſlowly and pleaſantly with a broken force) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Baſis of the Skull nigh the den made by the ingreſs of the lateral boſom; where being preſently intorted, it enters the proper Chanel inſculped in the Wedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Bone, and for the greater aſſurance it is clothed beſides with a thicker additional Coat. This double defence ſeems to be given it, leſt the blood, boiling up too much, and whilſt it is carried violently towards the head, ſhould make a Whirlpool about the ingreſs of the Skull, to wit, where it begins to be wreathed about from its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aſcent, and ſhould break by its flood the banks of the Belly, unleſs they were more firm. The Artery being ſlid out of the bony chanel, lays aſide alſo its aſcititious or additional Coat; and now being well enough defended within the Skull, goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward clothed only with its proper Coat, and creeps under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and being as it were depreſſed in the midſt of its paſſage into a valley, being immediately carried out again, it goes on till it comes to the head of the Turky Chair; where again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent in and intorted, with a certain compaſs, it aſcends ſtraight, and boring through the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> is carried towards the Brain. The Trunk of this <hi>Carotis,</hi> like a Meander, paſſing through the Skull with a very much bending way or paſſage, is aptly repreſented in the firſt Figure of the following Table.</p>
                     <p>If the reaſon of this kind of Conformation be inquired into, it eaſily occurs, that in an humane Head, where the generous Affections, and the great forces and ardors of the Souls are ſtirred up, the approach of the blood to the confines of the Brain, ought to be free and expeditious; and it is behoveful for its River not to run in narrow and manifoldly divided Rivulets, which would ſcarce drive a Mill, but always with a broad and open chanel, ſuch as might bear a Ship under Sail. And indeed, in this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107014:67"/>reſpect, a man differs from moſt brute beaſts, in which, the Artery being divided into a thouſand little ſhoots, leſt it ſhould carry the blood with a fuller chanel, or more quick courſe than is requiſite, makes the Net-like infoldings, by which indeed it comes to paſs, that the blood ſlides into the Brain very ſlowly, and with a gentle and almoſt even ſtream. If that be true, as ſome affirm, that the wonderful Net alſo is ſometimes found in an humane Brain, I believe it is only in thoſe ſort of men, who being of a ſlender wit or unmoved diſpoſition, and deſtitute of all force and ardor of the mind, are little better than dull working beaſts in fortitude and wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The conformation of the Carotidick Artery in a Horſe, comes neareſt its ſtructure in a man; for in this the Artery enters the Skull alſo lower, and with a greater compaſs than in other four-footed beaſts: which being paſſed, its Trunk being intorted, with a certain compaſs, and then a little depreſſed, goes forward whole to the ſide of the Turky Chair ſtill with a full and broad chanel: which truly ought to be made ſo, becauſe magnanimous and fierce forces are convenient for this Animal, born as it were for War and any dangerous attempts; and ſo there was need, that the blood might aſcend the Brain with a free and plentiful courſe, and (when occaſion requires) with a full Torrent. But though the blood paſſes through the Baſis of a Horſes Skull in the ſame undivided chanel, yet it ought not to come to the Brain it ſelf in one ſingle paſſage; becauſe the frame or ſubſtance of this in a Horſe being far weaker and colder than in a man, it might be overthrown and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood ruſhing in by heaps: wherefore the great River of the Artery disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens it ſelf by two Emiſſaries, and pours out its <hi>Latex</hi> at ſo many diſtinct places of the Brain. Further, as if by this means there were not yet ſufficient caution againſt the Deluge of the Brain, a tranſverſe or croſs chanel, as it were a diverſion, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med between the chanels of either Artery; through which the blood, being ſtraitned for room, may go aſide, and flow and reflow from one bank or chanel to another, rather than oppreſs or overflow the Brain. Alſo beſides, certain ſhoots being ſent out from the Trunk of either Artery, are inſerted into the pituitary Glandula, the uſe of which is doubtleſs to ſeparate certain ſeroſities of the too watry blood, and to lay them up into that Glandula, whereby the reſt of the bloody <hi>Latex,</hi> to be carried to the Brain, becomes more pure and free from dregs. By what means the Caroti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick Arteries, in the head of a Horſe, paſs through the Baſis of the Skull, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſecond Figure of the following Table. I have not yet had the means to inſpect the brains of a Lyon or a Monkey; but there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that in theſe alſo the Carotides do paſs through the Skull with a ſingle Trunk. In a Sheep, Calf, Hog, yea in a Dog, Fox, Cat, and other four-footed beaſts, which I have hitherto opened, this Artery is divaricated into Net-like infoldings, which Veſſels, for what cauſes and for what uſes they are ſo made, we ſhall now inquire into.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly therefore, moſt other four-footed beaſts, different from a Man and a Horſe, have the wonderful Net adjoyned to the Carotidick Artery. In truth, this is met with in ſo many, that common Anatomy hath aſcribed it to all Animals, and alſo to man it ſelf. In whom it is found, we obſerve, that the Artery, about to enter the Skull, is not carried about with ſo long a compaſs, but riſing up nigh the hinder part of the Turkiſh Chair, is preſently divided into ſmall ſhoots; yet ſo, as one little chanel is ſtretched right out, which the blood quietly running to, paſſes through without any ſtay, being carried ſtraight into the Brain: but from the ſide of this many rivulets are derived on every ſide, into which the blood impetuouſly aſcending, may be eaſily diverted. Theſe little rivers are partly ingrafted into the veinous paſſages of the ſame, and the Veſſels of the other ſide, and are partly carried into the pituitary Glandula, and partly a compaſs being fetched, are returned into the former chanel or belly of the Artery. That it is ſo, beſides naked inſpection, appears plainly by this Experiment. If below the Skull, an inky liquor be gently and by degrees injected into the Trunk of the <hi>Carotis,</hi> that paſſing through the ſtrait paſſage, is carried preſently into the Brain, nor does it dye the lateral infolded Veſſels with its tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but if this liquor be immitted continually and forcibly, preſently running into the folds, it will make black the Veſſels of the ſame and of the oppoſite ſide, alſo entring the hither part of the Glandula and its interior ſubſtance. If the uſe of theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels, or the wonderful Net be inquired into, I ſay, that it is made chiefly for theſe ends: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that the Torrent of the blood being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſmall rivulets, its more rapid courſe may be ſo far dull'd or broken, that it may be but leiſurely inſtilled into the Brain. For otherwiſe in labouring beaſts,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107014:68"/>who go with their heads hanging down, and have but a weak brain, the more free influx of the blood might eaſily overthrow the fabrick of the Brain, and ſpoil the animal Spirits. Secondly, the divarication of the <hi>Carotides</hi> into Net-like infoldings, hath another uſe of no leſs moment, to wit, that the more watry blood being (as it is its temperament in moſt Beaſts, and eſpecially in thoſe who are fed with herbage) before it be poured upon the Brain, might carry away ſome part of the ſuperfluous Serum to the pituitary Glandula, and inſtil the other part into the branches or ſhoots of the Veins to be returned towards the Heart. Thirdly and laſtly, for as much as the Veſſels on either ſide are mutually inoculated by this means, there is care taken both that the blood may be exactly mixed before it aſcends to the Brain, as alſo that more certain ways may be made for its paſſage: becauſe, if perchance an obſtruction ſhould happen in one ſide of the wonderful Net, the blood by that infolding being preſently carried to the other, may find a paſſage: for this cauſe, to wit, that the blood might be the better prevented from any impediment in its paſſage, the Veſſels are not only inoculated under the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> about the wonderful Net, but the Arteries again on either ſide, do the ſame thing as ſoon as they, being knit to the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> reach the ſuperficies of the Brain, as hath been already ſhewn. By theſe ſort of ingraftings of the Veſſels in the wonderful Net, it comes to paſs, that an inky liquor being injected into one of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> and forced upwards, deſcends by the Trunk of the Artery on the oppoſite ſide, as we have elſewhere obſerved. Some rude draught of the wonderful Net is expreſſed in the third Figure of the following Table.</p>

                        <p>The Vertebral Artery, ariſing from the branch in the fifth Rib, in its whole aſcent through the hinder part of the Head, paſſes through the little holes cut in the extube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> till it comes near the Baſis of the hinder part of the Head; where the ſame being bent down on either ſide, and admitted into the Skull by the laſt hole, excepting where the ſpinal Marrow goes forth, is carried by the ſide of the oblong marrow; but as ſoon as it is brought to the region of the Cerebel, it ſends forth branches on either ſide, which cover its ſuperficies, and beſides on its back ſide make infoldings no leſs ſignal than thoſe commonly called the <hi>Choroeides,</hi> and with larger Kernels more thickly interwoven. As <hi>thoſe</hi> ſhoots convey the Juyce requiſite for the ſtilling forth the animal Spirits, ſo <hi>theſe</hi> convey the heated blood and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the ſerous Colluvies. Further, beneath the Cerebel, both the Vertebral branches, inclining mutually one to another, are united, as it were for that end, that if the flowing of the blood ſhould be ſtopped on either ſide, it might be ſupplied from the other to the whole compaſs of the Cerebel and its neighbouring parts. Theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels covering the Cerebel, even as the others do the Brain, make ſignal infoldings both in its outward ſuperficies, and in that of the oblong marrow, and alſo within its lappets and folds; from which ſmall ſhoots are ſent forth every where into its under-lying ſubſtance: ſo that from theſe a ſubtil liquor, as it were ſtilled forth and imbibed by the Cortical ſubſtance of the Cerebel, ſeems to go into animal Spirits. By what means, and in what parts of the Head the production of the animal Spirits is performed, remains next to be inquired into.</p>

                     <p>FRom the deſcription of the Sanguiducts or Blood-carrying Veſſels, which cover and weave about on every ſide the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> hitherto handled, we are led by a certain thread to conſider by what proviſion, and in what places of the Brain and its Appendix the production of the animal Spirits is performed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, it appears from what hath been already ſaid, that the blood is it ſelf the matter out of which the animal Spirits are drawn; and that the Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and carrying it every where through the whole compaſs of the Head, are like diſtillatory Organs, which by circulating more exactly, and as it were ſubliming the blood, ſeparate its purer and more active particles from the reſt, and ſubtilize them, and at length inſinuate thoſe ſpiritualized into the Brain and its Appendix. Concerning this matter to be diſtilled, there is care taken, and indeed by the beſt means, that its ſtock or proviſion may be ſtill ſupplied in fit quality and due quantity.</p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:107014:70"/>
                     <p>In reſpect of the quality, from the whole bloody maſs, a portion highly volatile, ſpirituous, and endued with active Elements, ought conſtantly to ariſe towards the Head; which thing ſucceeds partly of its own accord, and partly that it might be more commodiouſly done, care is taken with a certain artificialneſs; to wit, the Vertebral Arteries, in all Creatures aſcending ſtraight, and almoſt perpendicularly, do in a manner cauſe, that only the more ſubtil and light blood is carried upwards, the remaining more thick as it were ſinking down for the baſer offices of the Limbs and of ſome of the Bowels. Yea, alſo the <hi>Carotides</hi> in a man, having an erected head higher than the reſt of the parts, and in a Horſe in ſome ſort lifting up his face, have alſo the ſame priviledge; to wit, that by their more ſteep aſcent only the more pure and volatile blood may aſcend to the region of the Brain. But in other four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed beaſts, who go with a prone or hanging head, and who have a more frigid and watry blood, which may eaſily ſlide into, and too much waſh the Brain, this evil is in ſome part prevented by the wonderful Net and pituitary Glandula joyned to the <hi>Carotides;</hi> which indeed receive the ſuperfluous humidities of the blood, and ſo make it more pure and free from dregs before it comes to the brain.</p>
                     <p>But that the blood may be ſupplied ſtill in due quantity, to wit, as it were in weight and meaſure, from the diſtillatory Veſſels, ſtretched about the compaſs of the Head, there is a notable proviſion made in all the <hi>Carotides</hi> about the Baſis of the Skull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their crooked imbowings and branching into infoldings, hinders the too great or too rapid approach of the blood: then, leſt the paſſage of it ſhould at any time be ſhut up, the mutual ingraftings of all the Veſſels on either ſide, do help or provide for. After this manner, the buſineſs of extracting the animal Spirits is performed even as a Chymical Elixir; to wit, great care is taken in the beginning of that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, both that choice of matter may be had, and that only a due proportion of it be expoſed to diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>The blood by this means, as it were a Chymical work prepared, is carried by the fourfold Chariot of the Arteries to four diſtinct regions of the Head: and as the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels, being diſtributed with ſeparate ramifications or branches through the whole compaſs of the Brain and its Appendix, cover all the heights of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſings about or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gyrations, and alſo all its crevices and their gapings and receſſes, they bring to their doors the matter to be diſtilled into the Head every where through the whole circumference of the Brain and Cerebel nigh the Cortical ſubſtance of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; out of which as the Spirits are diſtilled, by this means it is brought about, that they are inſinuated into the ſubjected ſubſtance of either. The blood being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the narrow infoldings and divarications of the Veſſels, as it were (as was ſaid) through the ſerpentine chanels of an Alembick is made extremely ſubtle, as much as may be, in its liquor; in the mean time, what is bloody is received by the little ſhoots of the Veins aſſociates, or meeting one another every where, and what is ſerous by the Kernels every where diſperſed; yet its more purified and ſpirituous part being carried on further through the very ſmall ſhoots ſent forth on all ſides, are inſtilled more deeply into the very Pores and paſſages of the Brain and Cerebel; which preſently flowing from the Cortical ſubſtance into the medullary, there exerciſe the gifts of the animal Function. What peculiar body and conſtitutive particles of the Brain it ſelf and Cerebel, conduce to the generation and perfection of the animal Spirits within the ſubſtance of either, ſhall be ſhewn hereafter, when we treat of the Uſe of thoſe Parts: now ſhall be taken notice of what we before mentioned, to wit, that the fluid extillation of the ſpirituous liquor from the blood about the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> is performed after a ſignal manner, both from the ambient heat, which is ſtirred up from the blood contained within the boſoms, as it were from a <hi>Balmo Mariae,</hi> inriched by the continual flowing of it anew, and alſo from the obduction of the Meninges, like an Alembick, by which the ſpirituous Particles, apt to fly away, are conſtrained and forced into the parts beneath.</p>
                     <p>But indeed, though the animal Spirits are procreated wholly from the blood, yet the blood watering the Brain and its Appendix, is not only beſtowed on this work: for as to the ſanguiferous Veſſels, which ariſing out of the Trunks both of the Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides and the Vertebrals, cover over the whole Head and all its parts and proceſſes; though many of them, yet not all, are little diſtillatory chanels of the animal Spirits. For the animal Spirits, are not produced in all places, to which theſe Veſſels reach; for we affirm, that theſe Spirits are only procreated in the Brain and Cerebel: (which it were eaſie to prove by the Symptoms which happen in the Apoplexy and Palſie, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107014:70"/>ſhall be afterwards clearly ſhewn) and from this double fountain of the animal Spirits they flow out into all the reſt of the parts, and irradiate, by a conſtant influence, the whole nervous ſtock. In the mean time, the oblong marrow and its various proceſſes and protuberances are either retreating places, or high roads for the animal Spirits, procreated in the Brain and Cerebel, and flowing from thence. But for as much as the Arteries and Veins clothe theſe parts alſo with a thick ſeries of ſhoots, and that within the infolding of the Brain the folds called <hi>Choroeides</hi> are hung ſlack and looſly, theſe ſeem to be ſo made for other reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> both that theſe parts might be actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by heat, ſupplied as it were from a continual fire, and alſo that the nouriſhing Juyce might be beſtowed on the Spirits which flow there.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, that the animal Spirits now perfected, may be freely expanded, and irradiate the nervous <hi>Syſtem,</hi> there ſeems to be required, that the ambient heat, being excited by the blood flowing thither, might open all the little ſpaces for their paſſage, and notably dilate or lay open for them ways or roads: wherefore we inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before, becauſe the little ſhoots of the Veſſels ought not to be deeply inſerted into the callous body, (for that, leſt the commerce of the Spirits, diverting in this Mart or meeting place, ſhould be diſturbed by the perpetual influence of the blood) therefore the infolding of the <hi>Choroeides</hi> is hung under its chamber, that at leaſt by this nigh ſituation, as by a Stove or Hot-houſe, the heat there might be preſerved. Beſides, we intimated another uſe of this infolding; to wit, that the blood, paſſing through the very narrow <hi>Meanders</hi> and convolutions or rollings about of the Veſſels, might lay aſide its ſerous recrements into the Glandula's or paſſages of the Veins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, That many branches and leſſer ſhoots of the ſame Veſſels which water the Brain and Cerebel, cover alſo the oblong marrow, and in ſome meaſure enter into its Pores and deeper ſubſtance (within which the animal Spirits are not begotten, but only exerciſed and expanded) I ſay, that this is ſo made for this other reſpect; to wit, that the ſubſtance of the oblong marrow might imbibe a conſtant proviſion of nouriſhment from the pouring in of the blood whereof it hath need. For whilſt the animal Spirits, flowing into the nervous ſtock from the Brain and Cerebel, paſs through this paſſage, as it were the high road, ſome food he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to them, as it were in their journey, from the watering blood: For indeed we ſuppoſe (which alſo will afterwards clearly appear) that the oblong marrow, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the nervous parts, is moiſtned with a double humor, <hi>viz.</hi> one ſpirituous and highly active, which flows altogether from the Brain and Cerebel, and being from thence derived into the whole nervous ſtock, beſtows upon them the ſenſitive and moving Faculties; and the other humor ſofter and more oily and ſulphureous, which being ſupplied from the blood, and affuſed immediately on every part, is the Author of their Heat and Vegetation. Both theſe Juyces agree among themſelves, and being every where joyned together and married, they are as it were a maſculine and feminine ſeed mixed together; and ſo they impart to all parts both ſenſe and motion, and all the powers of life and growth. Wherefore it is obſerved, that all the parts of the whole body, by which motion and ſenſe are performed, do not only ſwell up with the animal Spirit, of whoſe influence being deprived, they preſently ſuffer a reſolution or looſning; but alſo they admit the ſanguiferous Veſſels; of whoſe Tribute if they be defrauded, preſently they wither away, or are diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a mortification or Gangrene. Wherefore, that the fleſh, membranes, and all the hones may be watered with the blood, (as may be perceived by the help of a Microſcope) the very little or minute bodies of ſome of the Nerves are ſurrounded with Capillaments or little hairs of Arteries and Veins, together with their proper Fibrils, that we need not doubt to aſſert, that the Veſſels penetrating the ſuperficies of the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Cerebel,</hi> do diſtil into them a ſubtil matter for the generation of the animal Spirits; but that ſome other ſhoots of the ſame Veſſels, covering the oblong marrow, do only impart to it heat and nouriſhing Juyce. Laſtly, that the infoldings of the <hi>Choroeides</hi> were built under the chamber of the oblong marrow, chiefly for the diſpenſing of heat, and in ſome meaſure for the ſake of ſeparation of the ſerous <hi>Latex.</hi> But concerning theſe, we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more largely afterwards, when we ſhall treat of the nutritious and nervous Juyce, and when we ſhall conſider of that famous Controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi> whether nouriſhment is made by the blood or Nerves: further, we ſhall elſewhere ſpeak more fully of the Nature, Hypoſtaſis, and diverſe Diſpoſition of the animal Spirits; alſo, what the ſubſtance of the Brain, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the parts, may contribute to their production.</p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:107014:71"/>
                     <p>Thus far concerning the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> and the blood-carrying Veſſels, which are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in it, and following its protenſion, water the whole Head, we have treated largely. But before we quite leave the conſideration of this Membrane, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what ſenſe and motion it may have. Certainly it is not undeſervedly that we aſcribe the moſt cruel Head-aches to the more acute ſenſe of this; (in which however, by what means this Meninx is affected, does not ſo eaſily appear.) It is the common opinion, that ſharp and tormenting Vapours, being raiſed from the Viſcera of the lower Belly, eſpecially from the Ventricle, Hypochondria, or Womb ſtrike againſt this Membrane, and ſo pierce it with pain. But we ſay, though this be impoſſible, that Vapours paſſing ſo many interſtices and bars of the Viſcera and bones, without any trouble, ſhould ever come to the Head and hurt it: yet we do not deny, but that ſometimes vaporous Effluvia's do proceed from the blood boiling or eſtuating within the confines of the Brain, which being ſhut up together under the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and as it were gathered into a Cloud, do greatly blow up and diſtend it, and ſo diſtemper it with pain. I have often ſeen, in a Head newly opened after death, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> diſtended, and ſhining like a Bladder, that the ſame ſeemed to be intumified, with much water included under it; which notwithſtanding was found to be ſo done by wind diſtending the Membrane, for that being diſſected, that Tumor fell down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effuſion of water.</p>
                     <p>But we think the Head-aches, which happen by reaſon of the evil of this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, are chiefly excited by another means, to wit, for as much as this Meninx ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a breach of the unity by the blood boiling up above meaſure, and ruſhing into its Pores and ſo it is contracted into lighter Convulſions. I have ſometimes opened the Heads of the defunct, which when living, were obnoxious to moſt miſerable Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches; in which, near the longitudinal boſom, where the feat of the pains was, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> or interior, grew to the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> or exterior for ſome ſpace, oft-times for two fingers breadth, and by their growing together had excited a ſharp and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Tumor; in which the mouths of the Veſſels were ſo wholly ſtopped up, that there was left for the blood, though very much boiling up, no paſſage into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning boſom.</p>
                     <p>As to the motion of this Membrane, we wholly deny, that it hath in it ſelf a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Syſtole and Diaſtole; however, the Pulſes in ſome Arteries, have ſeemed ſomething like it, which have given occaſion perchance to this vulgar Opinion. Yet in the mean time, it may be lawful to believe, that this Meninx, for that it is very ſenſible, is rendred obnoxious to Cramps and convulſive motions: and that from its greater contraction the fits of the Falling-ſickneſs do ariſe, and from its leſſer and more partial corrugation or wrinkling together, Head-aches, as hath been ſaid, and alſo ſometimes Scotomies, Vertigoes, and often Convulſions of the Members and Viſcera, planted at a great diſtance from the origine of the Nerves, being drawn into conſent.</p>

                     <p>WE have thus far beheld the Coverings of the Brain, both the bony and the membranous, alſo the Arteries and Veins growing and knit to them, like Ivy, and diſtributed through the whole compaſs of the Head. There now remains, theſe coverings being removed, that we next conſider the Fabrick and true Hypotype or Character of the Brain and its Appendix, together with the action and uſe of all the parts. And here at firſt ſight we meet with three things, to wit, the Brain, the oblong Marrow, and the Cerebel: of which the oblong marrow ſeems to be a common Trunk, to which the Brain and Cerebel grow like branches: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome contend the medullary Rope to be the principal part, and the Brain and Cerebel its dependences. But that it is otherwiſe appears by this, becauſe theſe bodies, both in the generation and diſpenſation of the animal Spirits, are of more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107014:71"/>noble uſe than the oblong marrow; ſo that if the out-flowings of the Spirits from the Brain or Cerebel be ſhut up or hindred, the nervous Syſtem preſently ſuffers an Eclipſe; in the mean time, if this be primarily diſtempered, the Brain and Cerebel ſuffer not for its fault.</p>
                     <p>That we may begin with the Brain, it may be conſidered in a double reſpect; to wit, both as to its convex or exterior ſuperficies, as it is beheld in its proper ſite and poſition; and as to its interior cavity, to wit, as the Brain appears opened, its concave ſuperficies being expanded and turned upſide down. We have already taken care to delineate its true form or Type in either manner, by what hath been before ſaid, to wit, after what manner it is both within and without. There now remains, after its fabrick and conformation being rightly weighed, for us deſign its offices, and to ſhew the uſes of it and of every one of its parts. Concerning which, we ought to unfold in general, firſt, what the office of the whole Brain is, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we ſhall deſcend to particulars, there will come under conſideration, 1. The diviſion of the Brain, to wit, its double Hemiſphere, alſo the two Lobes or partitions of either. 2. The narrow crankling turnings and windings, or the gyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and convolutions or rolling together of the Brain. 3. Its double ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Cortical and Medullary. 4. The common Baſis of all, <hi>viz.</hi> the callous body. 5. Its ſubtenſion or <hi>Fornix.</hi> 6. The appenſion or circuit of the Brain over or above the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long marrow. 7. And what reſults from thence, the void ſpace or Ventricles made by its infolding together. Concerning theſe, we ſhall take notice of what things occur worth noting; concerning the ſmelling Nerves and their proceſſes, we ſhall inquire afterwards, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Brain is accounted the chief ſeat of the Rational Soul in a man, and of the ſenſitive in brute beaſts, and indeed as the chief mover in the animal Machine, it is the origine and fountain of all motions and conceptions. But ſome Functions do chiefly and more immediately belong to the ſubſtance of this, and others depend as it were mediately and leſs neceſſarily upon it. Among theſe, which of the former ſort are accounted the chief, are the Imagination, Memory, and Appetite. For it ſeems, that the Imagination is a certain undulation or wavering of the animal Spirits, begun more inwardly in the middle of the Brain, and expanded or ſtretched out from thence on every ſide towards its circumference: on the contrary, the act of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory conſiſts in the regurgitation or flowing back of the Spirits from the exterior compaſs of the Brain towards its middle. The Appetite is ſtirred up, for that the animal Spirits, being ſome-how moved about the middle of the Brain, tend from thence outwardly towards the nervous Syſtem. The reſt of the Faculties of this Soul, as Senſe and Motion, alſo the Paſſions and Inſtincts merely natural, though they depend in ſome meaſure upon the Brain, yet they are properly performed in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Marrow and Cerebel, or proceed from them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In ſome Animals, the ſubſtance of the Brain is divided into two parts, as it were Hemiſpheres, diſtinct one from another almoſt through its whole thickneſs, even to the callous body, which is inſtead of a bottom; and in like manner alſo in all the Senſories, and in moſt of the other Organs of the neceſſary Functions, the Brain is as it were twofold, that there might be a proviſion made againſt the defect of one ſide by the ſupplement of the other. Further, in man, who hath a brain more large and capacious than other Creatures, either Hemiſphere is again ſubdivided into two Lobes, to wit, the Anterior and the Poſterior; between which a branch of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidick Artery, being drawn like a bounding River to both, diſtinguiſhes them as it were into two Provinces. Certainly, this ſecond partition of the humane Brain alſo ſeems to be deſigned for its greater ſafety; that if perchance any evil ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to one or both the foremoſt Lobes, yet the latter, for that they are ſeparated, may avoid the contagion of the neighbouring and farther ſpreading evil: So the Brain, like a Caſtle, divided into many Towers or places of Defence, is thereby made the ſtronger and harder to be taken.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Alſo the univerſal frame of the Brain appears yet more divided and variegated within all its aforeſaid partitions; for all its whole exterior ſuperficies is made uneven and broken, with turnings and windings and rollings about, almoſt like thoſe of the Inteſtines. Thoſe Gyrations or Turnings going from the fore-part of the Brain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter with a creeping compaſs, and as it were a ſpiral circuit, encompaſſes both its Hemiſpheres, that they might mutually furniſh all the convolutions with a continued paſſage: in a more moiſt Brain, or long kept, the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> clothing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107014:72"/>every one, and collecting them together, is eaſily pulled away; and then the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or folds being opened and ſeparated one from another, the ſubſtance of the brain is ſeen to be plowed, or laid as it were with furrows; out of which ariſe banks or ridges of broken crevices, not in a direct ſeries, but croſs-wiſe; ſo that in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of every furrow, a convolution ariſing from the right ſide, is carried to the left, then others following next, being ſent from the left ſide, is drawn to the right, and ſo by turns the inequalities of the whole brain are variegated in this order.</p>
                     <p>If it be inquired into, what benefit its Turnings and Convolutions afford to the brain, or for what end its whole anfractuous or broken crankling frame is, we ſay, that the brain is ſo framed, both for the more plentiful reception of the ſpirituous aliment, and alſo for the more commodious diſpenſation of the animal Spirits for ſome uſes. As to the aliment to be beſtowed on the brain, becauſe it is required to be ſubtil and extremely wrought or elaborated; therefore it ought to be admitted, not by a more open paſſage, but only by very ſmall pores and paſſages. Wherefore that there might be ſufficient plenty of ſpirituous liquor ſupplied, it is not only drunk in every where in the plain ſuperficies of the brain from its Cortical ſubſtance; but that ſuperficies of the brain or Cortical ſubſtance is uneven and rough with folds and turnings about; that the ſpaces for the receiving the Juyce might be enlarged as much as may be: For the anfractuous or crankling brain, like a plot of ground, planted every where with nooks and corners, and danks and mole-hills, hath a far more ample extenſion, than if its ſuperficies were plain and even. Further, thoſe crank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the brain do more fitly hide the ſanguiferous Veſſels, for that they are very ſmall and ſlender, and more ſafely keep them, being variouſly interwoven into one anothers infoldings, than if they ſhould be openly diſtributed; for ſo being careleſly laid, they would be liable to too frequent hurt.</p>
                     <p>But a reaſon and neceſſity of the turnings about in the brain, and not of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the other, is fetched from the diſpenſation of the animal Spirits. For as the animal Spirits, for the various acts of Imagination and Memory, ought to be moved within certain and diſtinct limited or bounded places, and thoſe motions to be often iterated or repeated through the ſame tracts or paths: for that reaſon, theſe manifold convolutions and infoldings of the brain are required for theſe divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ordinations of the animal Spirits, to wit, that in theſe Cells or Store-houſes ſeverally placed, might be kept the ſpecies of ſenſible things, and as occaſion ſerves, may be taken from thence. Hence theſe folds or rollings about are far more and greater in a man than in any other living Creature, to wit, for the various and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold actings of the ſuperior Faculties; but they are garniſhed with an uncertain, and as it were fortuitous ſeries, that the exerciſes of the animal Function might be free and changeable, and not determined to one. Thoſe Gyrations or Turnings about in four footed beaſts are fewer, and in ſome, as in a Cat, they are found to be in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain figure and order: wherefore this Brute thinks on, or remembers ſcarce any thing but what the inſtincts and needs of Nature ſuggeſt. In the leſſerfour-footed beaſts, alſo in Fowls and Fiſhes, the ſuperficies of the brain being plain and even, wants all cranklings and turnings about: wherefore theſe ſort of Animals comprehend or learn by imitation fewer things, and thoſe almoſt only of one kind; for that in ſuch, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Cells, and parted one from another, are wanting, in which the divers Species and Ideas of things are kept apart.</p>
                     <p>But that in more perfect Animals, all the turnings about are made of a twofold ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Cortical and Medullary; the reaſon ſeems to be, that one part may ſerve for the production of the animal Spirits, and the other for their exerciſe and diſpenſation. For we may well think, that the animal Spirits are wholly or for the moſt part procreated in the Cortical ſubſtance of the brain; for this ſevers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives immediately from the blood the ſubtil liquor, and imbuing it with a volatile Salt, exalts it into very pure Spirits. It is obvious to every one, that the Arteries enter the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the brain with a more frequent inſertion of ſhoots, and inſtil to it a ſpirituous liquor; the leavings of which, or what is ſuperfluous, the Veins in like manner entring it, do ſup up and carry away; in the mean time, the more ſubtil portion being here ſet free, goes into Spirits. In truth, the blood waters the medullary ſubſtance of the brain in a very ſmall quantity; which ſeems truly to be rather for the ſake of exciting of heat, than that the animal Spirits ſhould there be generated by the flowing in of that blood. For indeed, the volatile Salt, which like Ferment, ſpiritualizes the ſubtil liquor ſtilled forth from the blood, is had more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107014:72"/>copiouſly in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the brain, rather than in its middle or marrowy part; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that part, being endued with an Aſhy colour, ſhews by its aſpect the ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Particles and Humor contained in them, in which Spirit and a volatile Salt very much abounds; yea and plainly reſembles an Armeniack ſmell, (ſuch as either part alike breathe forth.) In the mean time, the medullary part of the brain ſeems very like the oblong marrow and the ſpinal. But it is well enough known, that theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary parts ſerve for the exerciſe and diſpenſation of the animal Spirits, and not for their generation. The ſign of which is, that where-ever an obſtruction happens in them, whatever is below, being deſtitute of the influx of the Spirits, ſuffers an Eclipſe; whence it follows, that the animal Spirits, irradiating the medullary Rope, are not produced in it, but flow in from elſewhere; and why ſhould not we think the ſame of the middle marrow of the brain? Truly, that this part is rather the Mart or Exchange of the Spirits than its Shop or Work-houſe, appears from hence, becauſe the Animals which excel in Memory, Imagination, and Appetite, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a more ample marrow of the brain; as is obſerved in man and the more perfect four-footed beaſts: and they who ſeem to have little need of thoſe Faculties, as the leſſer four-footed beaſts, alſo Fowls and Fiſhes have the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the brain greater, but the medullary part very ſmall. It is a familiar Experiment among Boys to thruſt a needle through the head of a Hen, and that ſhe in the mean time, whoſe brain is ſo pierced through, ſhall live and be well a long time. The reaſon of which is, becauſe the whole ſubſtance of the brain in theſe ſort of Animals is almoſt merely Cortical; wherefore from the ſuffering ſuch a hurt, (as long as the marrow remains unhurt) the Spirits are generated in a leſſer quantity, but their commerce to the neceſſaries of life, are not therefore preſently interrupted. Indeed the brains of Birds conſiſt almoſt wholly of a Cortical and Aſhy part; and the medullary part is exceeding ſmall, and is only like a ſmaller Nerve deſcending on either ſide from the ſubſtance of the brain it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>After the animal Spirits are begot by a conſtant afflux of the blood within the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, being there begotten, having obtained a watry Vehicle, they flow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently more inwardly, and ſoon enter into the marrows, filling the furrows and baulks of all the turning and winding Crevices; from whence being carried farther through all the particular tracts of each marrow into the marrowy ſubſtance, which lyes under all the winding Crevices, as their common Baſis, they are brought at laſt into the <hi>Callous Body,</hi> as into a ſpacious field; where, as in a free and open place, theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being newly produced, are expatiated or iſſue forth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Indeed this medullary ſubſtance called the <hi>Callous Body,</hi> which chambering the more inward ſuperficies of the brain, receives into it ſelf the marrow of all the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Crevices, ſeems to be made for that end, and diſpoſed there for the ſame purpoſe; to wit, that the Spirits flowing into it on every ſide, might be ſtretched out as in their proper Sphere, and begin to exerciſe the acts of the animal Faculties. In this place, they which come out of the ſeveral winding Crevices, do meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and remain as in a publick <hi>Emporium</hi> or Mart; from whence, as occaſion ſerves, they are raiſed up, and drawn forth for the uſes of every Faculty. But whilſt they here remain at leiſure and not buſied, they become purified or refined more and more by a continual circulation: becauſe theſe Spirits new-born, do gently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually flow on every ſide from the outmoſt bounds of this body (to wit, where this common marrow beſmears the hinder productions of the brain, or the border of either of its Hemiſpheres) towards the fore-part of this <hi>callous Body,</hi> where it is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and there, if there be need, they are employed on the act of the Imagination, or entring the ſhanks of the <hi>oblong Marrow,</hi> they actuate and inſpire the nervous <hi>Appendix:</hi> but what Spirits are remaining there, after theſe offices are ſerved, run forthwith into the <hi>Fornix,</hi> and paſſing through its paſſage, they are remanded back again to the hinder region of the brain by a certain circulation; and laſtly, after this manner, penetrating through the narrow paſſages of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> thoſe Spirits are made more ſubtil, and alſo, as it ſeems moſt likely, they perform in this circulary motion thoſe more ſubtil acts of the Phantaſie.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Truly, that we may here ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> it ſeems that this part ſerves for a twofold uſe: <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, leſt the more inward ſides of the Brain hanging ſlack and looſly, might fall together among themſelves, or might be removed beyond the limits of a juſt protenſion or out-ſtretching; for they, not only by the coming between of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and by little cords drawn from it, cohere to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107014:73"/>the oblong marrow and the Cerebel; but beſides, the <hi>Fornix,</hi> like a Ligament or ſtring brought from one end of the brain to the other, conſtrains and keeps its whole frame in its due figure and ſituation. For this part purely medullar, and of the ſame ſubſtance with the callous Body, ſeems to be a certain proceſs of this, which ariſing more forward between the ſtreaked bodies, and falling upon the two ſhanks of the oblong marrow, firſt of all diſtinguiſhes them; afterwards, being ſeparated from them, is carried through the midſt of the cavity, and about the hinder part of the brain is divided as it were into two Arms, which being bent on both ſides, and again cleaving to the border of the <hi>callous Body,</hi> ſtrictly embrace the oblong marrow, and knit and firmly tye the hinder bulk of the brain to its Trunk, leſt it ſhould flow or ſlide forth. But the other, and that the more noted uſe of the <hi>Fornix</hi> ſeems to be what we but now mentioned; to wit, that the animal Spirits may immediately paſs through its paſſage from one end of the brain to the other, and ſo; as it were through the bill of a <hi>Pelican,</hi> they might be circulated into their own intorted belly.</p>
                     <p>That thoſe things which were but now declared concerning the <hi>Penetralia</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receſſes of the Brain, may be the better underſtood, we will here add a Scheme of its Sphere turned inſide out, and ſtretched out as it were upon a plain, ſo that the concave and inmoſt ſuperficies of the <hi>callous Body,</hi> together with the <hi>Fornix,</hi> may be ſufficiently ſeen.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Shews with what motion and tendency of the Animal Spirits the Exerciſes of the Animal Faculties are performed within the Confines of the Brain: Alſo what the uſe of its Ventricles is.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HItherto ſetting forth the uſes and offices of the Brain, properly ſo called, and of its parts, we have ſhewed after what manner the animal Spirits are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created from the blood in this their principal Shop or Work-houſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what diverting places, they being newly brought forth, do depart of themſelves, and are there kept as it were in diſtinct Cloiſters or Cells to be drawn forth for the manifold Exerciſes of the animal Function. But becauſe theſe Spirits, ſo brought to perfection, and ready for their work within the ſame parts of the Brain, enter into other manner of motions, and divers ways of emanations; therefore before we proceed any further, for the ſearching out their tracts within the oblong Marrow and Cerebel, we ought to declare concerning theſe Spirits diſpoſed within the confines of the Brain it ſelf, with what forces they are furniſhed, in what form they unfold themſelves, and in what ways they diffuſe themſelves and go forward as often as being muſtered in due order, they produce the acts of the Imagination, Memory, Appetite, and other ſuperior Faculties of the Soul. But for as much as hereafter, when we have finiſhed the explication of the Head and nervous Appendix, we have reſolved, for a concluſion, to treat of the Soul of Brutes and its powers, I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the preſent lay aſide this task; unleſs that in the mean time it may not ſeem amiſs to give a taſte only in general of theſe few things: <hi>viz.</hi> as there are two parts of the inferior Soul, or of Beaſts, to wit, the vital or flamy, being inkindled in the blood, and the ſenſitive or lucid, being diffuſed through the whole Head and its nervous dependences, the animal Spirits being continually produced in the Brain and in the Cerebel, do conſtitute a double as it were Root or Fountain of this lucid part: yea, the Spirits of either linage, for as much as they are continued both within thoſe Fountains, and from thence through the frame or ſubſtance of the nervous Syſtem, as it were under the ſame beamy <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> and contexture, they effect or cauſe the whole <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or ſubſiſtency of the ſenſitive Soul.</p>
                     <p>But there happen to this Soul, becauſe it is apt to be moved with a various impulſe, and ſo to contract or dilate its ſpecies in the whole, or in part, for that reaſon divers manners both of Actions and of Paſſions, to wit, the Senſes, which we call its Paſſions; and Motions, which we name the Actions of the ſame. The formal reaſon of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Senſes, conſiſts in the retraction or drawing back of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or a flowing back towards their Fountains. For where-ever the impreſſion of a ſenſible object is carried to this radiant or beamy contexture, preſently either the whole frame, or ſome portion of it, whereby it admits the ſpecies, is compelled to wag, and to be moved back, as it were to leap back and recede into it ſelf: on the contrary, the actions or motions of this Soul are made, for that this ſhadowy Spirit, being incited or ſtirred up in the whole, or in a certain part, unfolds it ſelf more largely, and by an emanation, and as it were a certain vibration of the Spirits, exerts or puts forth its virtue and force of acting.</p>
                     <p>Both the Senſes and Motions of this ſenſitive Soul are made either tranſient, when the Spirits, or its conſtitutive Particles, being moved ſomewhere in the Syſtem of the Nerves, draw together with them the containing parts, and deflect them with the like carriage or geſture with themſelves, as is obſerved in the five outward Senſes, and the local motions of the Members: or elſe, either both Actions and Paſſions are continuing, to wit, when both the Motions and Senſes are ſilently performed without any great agitation or moving of the body, or its parts, within the firſt Fountains of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head it ſelf. Theſe kind of Paſſions indeed, made within the ſubſtance of the Brain, are the common Senſe and Imagination; but the Actions are Memory, Phantaſie, and Appetite: and either of theſe, as to their beginnings and inſtincts, depend for the moſt part upon the outward Senſes.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the former, we take notice, that as often as the exterior part of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107014:75"/>Soul being ſtruck, a ſenſible impreſſion, as it were the Optick Species, or as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation or waving of waters, is carried more inward, bending towards the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered bodies, a perception or inward ſenſe of the Senſation outwardly had or received, ariſes. If that this impreſſion, being carried farther, paſſes through the <hi>callous Body,</hi> Imagination follows the Senſe: Then if the ſame fluctuation of Spirits is ſtruck againſt the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, as its utmoſt banks, it impreſſes on it the image or character of the ſenſible Object, which, when it is afterwards reflected or hent back, raiſes up the Memory of the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>The active Powers of this Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Local Motion, Memory, Phantaſie, and Appetite follow ſometimes immediately the Paſſions, ſometimes are induced apart from them upon other occaſions. For indeed the ſenſible impreſſion ſtriking the ſtreaked or chamfered bodies, oftentimes, the Brain being in no wiſe affected, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the local Motions to be retorted with a reciprocal tendency of the animal Epirits; ſo in ſleep (the Appetite knowing nothing of it) when pain troubles, preſently we rub the place, moving the hand to it: but more often, after that the ſenſible Species, having paſt from the common Senſory to the <hi>callous Body,</hi> hath ſtirred up the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Spirits, reflecting from thence, and flowing back towards the nervous Appendix, raiſe up the Appetite and Local Motions, the Executors or Performers of the ſame: And ſometimes a certain ſenſible impreſſion, being carried beyond the callous Body, and ſtriking againſt the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain it ſelf, raiſes up other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies lying hid there, and ſo induces Memory with Phantaſie, alſo often with Appetite and Local Motion aſſociates. Further, theſe active Powers, ſometimes upon other occaſions, are wont to be ſtirred up and exerciſed apart from Paſſion. In Man, the Rational Soul variouſly moves the ſenſitive, and at its pleaſure draws forth and brings into act its Powers, ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe. Moreover, the blood boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up above meaſure, and by that means ſtriking impetuouſly the border of the Brain, excites the ſpecies of things lurking in it, and driving them forward towards the middle or marrowy part of the Brain, cauſes alſo the various Acts of the Phantaſie and Memory to be repreſented.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the aforeſaid interior or abiding Faculties, we ſhall at preſent further take notice, that their more perfect Exerciſes are chiefly and almoſt only performed by the Spirits already perfected and highly elaborated; for thoſe a making, or that are new made, being numerous, they very much obſtruct and hinder the acts of the animal Function: to wit, when from the Veſſels, on every ſide watering the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, the ſubtil Liquor is plentifully inſtilled for the matter of the animal Spirits, this flowing inwardly ſtuffs all the pores and paſſages of the Brain, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for that time the Spirits from their wonted tracts and orbs of expanſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilſt the chief reflection of the Brain and Spirits is celebrated, ſleep, or an Eclipſe of the animal Spirits happens; then waking returns, when from the Liquor inſtilled, the more ſubtil part is exalted into very pure Spirits, and at length the more watry, being partly reſolved into Vapours, is exhaled, and partly ſupped up by the paſſages of the Veins entring the ſubſtance of the Brain, or elſe is ſweat out into the vacuity lying under the callous Body. Concerning theſe. I hope we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more largely afterwards. In the mean time; that we may proceed to the reſt of the things propoſed, concerning the frame of the Brain, properly ſo called, there yet remains that we ſpeak of its Ventricles: But ſince they are only a vacuity reſulting from the folding up of its exterior border, I ſee no reaſon we have to diſcourſe much of their office, no more than Aſtronomers are wont of the empty ſpace contained within the vacuity of the Sphere.</p>
                     <p>But in truth, as there is nothing met with in Nature that is not deſtinated to ſome uſe, ſurely we ſuſpect this ſame <hi>Vacuum</hi> or empty ſpace not to be built in vain within the Globe of the Brain. The Ancients have ſo magnified this Cavern, that they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it the Shop of the animal Spirits, both where they themſelves were procreated, and performed the chief works of the animal Function. But on the other ſide, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns or thoſe of later days have eſteemed theſe places ſo vile, that they have affirmed the ſame to be mere ſinks for the carrying out the excrementitious matter. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that opinion of the Ancients is eaſily overthrown, for that the animal Spirits, being very ſubtil, and apt to fly away, require not ſuch large and open ſpaces, rather than the more narrow paſſages and little pores, ſuch as are made in the ſubſtance of the Brain: for theſe Spirits (becauſe they ought; for the various Faculties of the Soul, to be compoſed into various ſeries, and divers orders and diſpoſitions, therefore)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107014:75"/>ought to be moved within peculiar orbs and tracts. Further, if any one ſhall exactly conſider the fabrick of the Brain, and ſeriouſly weigh, that theſe Ventricles are not formed out of the primary intention of Nature, but reſult only ſecondarily and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally from the complication of the Brain, he will be far from thinking, that the ſupreme ſeat of the Soul is fixed there, where being hem'd in with a moſt noble Guard of Spirits, it doth execute and perform its Functions. For it neither appears at all out of what matter, and by what artifice the Spirits are there begotten, nor by what ways of emanation they are derived from thence into the other parts of the Brain and nervous Syſtem. Wherefore almoſt all Anatomiſts, who are of a later Age, have attributed that vile office of a Jakes or ſink to this more inward chamber of the Brain. To which Opinion there has been ſome truſt given, for that theſe Ventricles are often ſeen in the dead to be filled with water; alſo from theſe, ways ſeem to lye open for excretion, both towards the Tunnel, and alſo into the Sieve-like Bone. It is obſerved, that where-ever the blood flows more copiouſly into any part, and waters it, there Vapors or watry Humors are begotten from the ſuperfluous Serum left in the circulation, which for the moſt part either exhale out through vaporous Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's, or are brought back into the blood by the Veins or Lymphatick Veſſels. But when the blood, by a plentiful influx, waters not only the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, but the interior marrow alſo, it remains, that the ſerous <hi>Latex</hi> (when-ever it abounds more in the blood, than that its ſuperfluities may be reduced immediately by the Veins, or by the Lymphaeducts, if they be there, or may be ſeparated by the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's) ſhould ſlide down into this den, made hollow within the infolding of the Brain. Truly there are many inſtances, which plainly evince, that the ſerous humors are ordinarily laid up in the Ventricles of the Brain. Anatomical Obſervations of men dying of many Cephalick diſeaſes, and eſpecially of ſoporiferous or ſleepy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, confirm this. Yea, it may be lawfully thought, that natural ſleep follows, for that the Pores and paſſages of the Brain are occupied and ſtuffed with a watry <hi>Latex,</hi> which ſerves for a Vehicle to the Spirits. Then as often as a profound ſleep invades any one from a Surfeit, or drinking of Wine, the cauſe is, that the little ſpaces in the medullary ſubſtance of the Brain, deſtinated for the motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are too much obſtructed by a Narcotick or a watry humor: certain reliques of which, being reſolved into vapor, and thruſt out from the company of the Spirits, do often ſweat out, or drop into this <hi>Vacuum</hi> or empty ſpace.</p>
                     <p>After this manner, it may be believed concerning the Ventricles of the Brain, or the empty ſpace left within its plicature or folding together. But in truth, becauſe this matter hath been very much controverted among Phyſicians of every Age, and the right deciſion of it ſeems to be of great moment, for the explicating the offices of the other parts of the Head; I will here compare together the reaſons for and againſt this Opinion, that we may at length give our Judgment of this Opinion, what may be either true, or moſt likely.</p>

                           <hi>It is inquired into, whether the ſerous Humors, heaped together within the Vacuity of the Brain, be ſent out by the Pituitary Glandula and the Sieve-like Bone, or not?</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce Experience teſtifies, that the Serum and excrementitious, I may juſtly ſay morbifick, and oftentimes deadly Humors, are found frequently within theſe Ventricles of the Brain; we ought to inquire more diligently concerning their paſſage in and out: and the rather, for that it is very much doubted by ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of theſe Dens, nor are there wanting thoſe in this late Age, who have endeavoured to bring into vogue the ancient Opinion, though long ſince exploded, concerning the Spirits being begot in this place, and here exerciſed. I believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, for the reaſons before alledged, that the Spirits are not here begotten, nor exerciſed: and no leſs certain is it made by Experience, that the ſerous Colluvies is here often gathered together. This therefore only remains, that we ſhould ſee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107014:76"/>from whence, and how this flows hither, and then by what ways of Excretion the ſame ſhould be carried out.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, it is exceeding probable, that the ſerous <hi>Latex,</hi> which is the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle of the Spirits newly produced, and is introduced together with them into the Pores of the Brain, after it is grown ſtale, and being attenuated into Vapour, doth diſtil forth into this Cavern, and there at laſt grows into a watry Humor: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what becomes of that Humor, or into what other Receptacle could it be derived? Beſides this ordinary, and I believe aſſiduous heaping together of the ſerous Colluvies within the Ventricles of the Brain, certainly it may be believed, that this kind of ſerous Humor is diſtilled out of the Glandula's inſerted in the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding, being too much filled, into the Ventricles ſo called. I have often ſeen in a Dropſie the Glandula's of the Brain to be intumified, and like grains of Barley, burſting with too much wet, to become flaccid or withered, ſo that they could not retain the ſero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities brought to them, but continually diſpoſed them into the Cavity beneath. Truly in a Dropſie of the Brain theſe Cavities or Ventricles are always ſeen to be full of water; the cauſe of which kind of diſtemper is, the blood being made more watry, puts off in its circulation a greater heap of Serum than the Veins can preſently carry back, or the Glandula's are able to receive and retain. For indeed, that the Serum, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding on every ſide from the Veſſels, may the better ſlide into the Ventricles of the Brain, it is ſo ordered, that the greater infoldings of the Veſſels, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Glandula's, ſhould be diſpoſed near all the Ventricles of the Head: becauſe, not only the infolding <hi>Choroeides</hi> is placed nigh the concourſe of the three Ventricles in the Brain, but another infolding, and no leſs noted, (which we above deſcribed) with greater Glandula's, is ſet behind the Cerebel nigh the fourth Ventricle. In all, as it ſeems, for that end ſuch care is taken, that the watry part, coming from the blood, which is deſtinated either for the Brain or the Cerebel, for that it is not fit for the procreating of Spirits, might run into theſe infoldings of the Veſſels. But yet if a greater plenty of Serum be there laid up, than can be contained in them, or may be ſent away outwardly, whatever is ſuperfluous will ſlide into the Cavity under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears, from whence, and by what means the ſerous heap is gathered together within the Ventricles of the Brain: certainly to deny this going out is no other than to aſſert every ones Brain big with a Viper, which cannot be brought forth but by gnawing aſunder the bowels of its parent. Who ſhall lightly conſider the parts nigh the Ventricles, and their Fabricks, at firſt ſight only would ſwear with the Ancients, that the excrements of the brain were laid aſide both lower through the Tunnel into the Palate, and above or more forward through the mammillary Proceſſes into the Noſtrils: But if the ſtructure of theſe parts be a little more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched into, there is no body who preſently will not eaſily think, that by neither of theſe ways the excretion of any humor can be made; for neither from the pituitary Glandula through the Wedge-like bone, nor from the mammillary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes through the holes of the Sieve-like bone, is there any manifeſt aperture or opening to be perceived. But in very truth, we do ſuppoſe that the brain is in ſome meaſure purged by both theſe Emunctories, for that objection may be anſwered, That the tranſlations of Humors in living Creatures are eaſily performed through places that ſeem impervious or unpaſſable; for while the Pores and paſſages in all the parts of a living Creature are dilated by ſpirit and heat, they tranſmit the rain of the Serum as through the fine texture of a woolen Cloth. This plainly appears from Arthritick diſtempers, in which the ſerous <hi>Latex</hi> creeps by degrees through the nervous bodies, and paſſing through very ſmall ſpaces, makes a falling down of humors ſometimes upon theſe parts, and ſometimes upon others; ſo that it is obvious, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and nervous Proceſſes drink in the ſerous humors like Sponges, and then by a light compreſſion render them by heaps, as is manifeſt in the Tooth-ach; for as often as a Bodkin or Inſtrument is put up into a hollow Tooth, clear water will come out plentifully. Indeed, in the body of a living Creature the paſſages of humors are not only made through open paſſages and chanels; but the thinner and more watry <hi>Latex</hi> creeps through the ſolid and ſmooth bodies of the Nerves, as alſo the Fibres and the Membranes, as through the holes of a Filtre, and ſo is transferred through impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtraits from place to place. I ſometime knew in the Impoſtume of the Lungs the humor to have been derived through the Membranes growing to the <hi>Pleura</hi> from the bag into an Iſſue made in the ſide, and ſo the ſpitting ceaſing, the diſeaſe that ſeemed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107014:76"/>otherwiſe incurable, was healed by ſuch a way of Evacuation. Why in like manner may we not ſuppoſe the ſerous humors falling down from the Ventricles of the Brain into the pituitary Glandula, and the mammillary Proceſſes to be carried away through the Nerves or Membranes paſſing through here or there?</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Tunnel, the thing is probable enough; becauſe the poſition and ſtructure of this ſeem to ſhew, that ſome humor is carried out of the Ventricles of the Brain towards the pituitary Glandula. For this part is ſo conſtituted, that a falling down of the humors may be made from every angle and receſs of the interior Brain and its Appendix into its aperture or opening. And as in ſeveral Animals, the figure and ſite of the Ventricles vary very much, (as we have already ſhewn) yet in every one of them all the Ventricles of the Head, whatſoever they be, have their openings gaping towards the Tunnel. But that this Kernel or Glandula, to which the paſſage of the Tunnel is inſerted, receives and carries out the ſerous humors, ſeems alſo to appear from hence; becauſe it admits, not only thoſe falling from the brain into its Pores, but alſo thoſe ſecreted from the blood aſcending into the brain: For that in many four-footed beaſts, certain Veſſels are inſerted to this Glandula from either Carotidick Artery, which intimately enters its ſubſtance: a ſign of which is, that Ink being injected into the Trunk of either Artery, dyes with a black colour the wonderful Net, if it be there, and oftner the interior ſubſtance of this Glandula: whence it may be argued, that the office of this Glandula is to receive the ſuperfluous ſeroſities; and it receives not only thoſe ſent away in the return from the brain, but ſometimes preoccupies or prevents them, and is wont to derive them from the blood before it is carried to the brain. And therefore this Glandula is very ſmall, if the ſuperfluities of the Serum be derived to it only from the brain; but greater, if they come to it alſo from the blood, to wit, as it executes either one or a double office, as we have already ſhewn at large.</p>
                     <p>But as to what reſpects the way of paſſing through, to wit, by which the humors, depoſited in this Glandula, are carried out, the vulgar Opinion is, that they do come away through the holes of the bone beneath into the Palate: wherefore in thoſe kind of Animals, who have the wonderful Net, and many of its ſhoots enter this Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, more holes are made in the underlying bone. Further, if you take away the ditch or gutter of the Wedge-like bone, or the ſeat of this Glandula, cut off from the Skull, and pour water upon its holes being made bare from the Membrane, it paſſing preſently through the ſubſtance of the whole bone, will ſuddenly ſtill forth through other holes lying open in the ſides of the bone. Yet this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes nothing for the Opinion propoſed: becauſe theſe holes are wholly wanting in ſome Creatures, and very much in an humane Skull; in thoſe who have them, as in a Calf, eſpecially it is obſerved, that the ſame are filled by ſome hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Veſſels; into which if a black liquor be caſt by a Syringe, that paſſing through the ſubſtance of the bone, will go into many other Veſſels lying under the bone, and at length into the Trunk of the Jugular Vein; which certainly is a ſign that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are not carried from hence into the Palate. But as to the Veſſels which cover over the holes of the bone, and which more abundantly lye under the ſame, they ſeem to be either Veins or Lymphaeducts.</p>
                     <p>But among theſe it is lawful to conjecture, the chief means of Excretion, whereby the ſerous humors, laid up in the pituitary Kernel, may be carried out; to wit, that they are remanded back from it, as from moſt other Glandula's or Kernels, into the maſs of blood. In a Calf the thing lies open to ocular inſpection, nor is it to be doubted of other Animals, who have the admirable Net: becauſe, as the arterious branches, ſo alſo the veinous reach to this Glandula; which ſup up not only the humors depoſited from the Arteries, but alſo thoſe falling from the Ventricles of the Brain. Yea, it may be lawfully believed, that in a Man alſo, a Horſe, and in other Creatures, who want the ſtrange or wonderful Net, there are other Lymphaeducts or Water-carriers, or ſome ſuch kind of Veſſels, as are ſeen in the head of a Calf, that moſt certainly carry the humors from this Glandula. We cannot ſo eaſily find out their footſteps, becauſe, before theſe break out of their dens, the tracts of the Lymphaeducts, if there be any, would vaniſh. Nor can we find out theſe Veſſels in all, as in a Calf, by injection; becauſe the holes of the bone, by which, as by the leading of a thread, the injection arrives at, and dyes the Veſſels, otherwiſe lying hid, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nting in moſt. No doubt but time will render ſufficiently manifeſt the reductions of the humors from the pituitary Glandula in other living Creatures: in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107014:77"/>the mean time, it may be lawfully ſuſpected, for that the ſeroſities in ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from thence into the bloody maſs, that in all it is done after the like or the ſame manner, although the ways of the paſſing do not yet ſufficiently lye open.</p>
                     <p>As to the other Emunctory of the Brain, to wit, whereby the ſerous humors, laid aſide from the Ventricles of the Brain into the mammillary Proceſſes, and thence are thought to be ſent away through the holes of the Sieve like bone: truly, concerning this way of Excretion, it is much more to be doubted, becauſe theſe holes in the defunct being covered over and fully ſtufft, with the inſertions of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> and nervous Fibres, ſent on either ſide from the mammillary Proceſs, tranſmit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of humor, how clear ſoever it be. Further, there is nothing more certain, than that the ſerous humors are preſſed out from the Glandula's and extremities of the Veſſels ending within the Noſtrils into their Caverns; ſo beſides that 'tis ſcarce poſſible for the humors to deſcend thither from the brain, it is not abſolutely needful to ſuppoſe this ſort of means of Excretion. But that we may reaſon a little farther concerning theſe; if it may be lawful to argue from the proviſion, and from the effects of the parts, there is no reaſon but that I may probably believe, that ſome humors alſo do ſhower down from the Brain into the cavities of the Noſtrils: for it being ſuppoſed, that the ſerous humor paſſes through, not only open chanels, but the more ſtrict Pores and paſſages alſo of the Nerves, and creeping both through the Fibres and Membranes, as through the ſtraining or holes of a Filter or Strainer, is carried from place to place, (which it were eaſie to demonſtrate) what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that the ſame ſort of <hi>Latex</hi> may deſcend through the Fibres impacted in the holes of the ſtraining bone? For although in dead Creatures thoſe parts ſeem to be impervious or unpaſſable, yet during the life of the Animal the paſſages and blind ways of the nervous bodies, being dilated by Spirit and Heat, moſt eaſily tranſmit a copious humor wherewith they are watered.</p>
                     <p>The Sieve-like Bone in divers Animals is variouſly perforated for the manifold neceſſity and difference of ſmelling. A Proceſs from the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold nervous Fibres paſs through every one of its holes, and beſmear the inſide of the Noſtrils. But as the impreſſions of ſenſible things, or ſenſible Species, continued as it were by the undulation or waving of the animal Spirits, aſcend through the paſſages of theſe bodies ſtretched out from the Organ towards the Senſory; ſo the humidities wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the ſame bodies, for as much as ſometimes they may be more ſuperfluous than uſual, may diſtil into the Noſtrils through the ſame ways. For indeed ſuch humors as are perpetually to be ſent away from the brain, ought ſo copiouſly to be poured upon the Organs of Smelling, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the ſmelling Nerves; in the mean time, that there is ſuch a way of Excretion opening into the Noſtrils, ſome obſervations, taken of ſick people troubled with Cephalick dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, do further perſwade. I have known ſome very obnoxious to the Scotomy and Vertiginous diſtempers, who had great plenty of clear water that diſtilled forth about the end of the Fit; by which kind of Evacuation, as it were Critical, the Fit was wont to be ended. Not long ſince, a Virgin living in this City, was afflicted a long time with a moſt cruel Head-ach, and in the midſt of her pain much and thin yellow Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum daily flowed out from her Noſtrils: the laſt Winter this Excretion ſtopped for ſome time, and then the ſick party growing worſe in her Head, ſell into cruel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, with a ſtupidity; and within three days dyed Apoplectical. Her Head being opened, that kind of yellow <hi>Latex</hi> overflowed the deeper turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Brain and its interior Cavity or Ventricles. I knew a Gentlewoman that was wont to be infeſted with a moſt cruel Head-ach, alſo with a Vertigo, and a frequent melting of the animal Spirits, or Swooning away; who when ſhe began to be better, after a grievous Fit, felt at firſt a creeping motion in the top of her Brain, as it were the ſliding down of water: then that motion paſſing a little more forwards and downwards, at length many drops of clear water diſtilled from her Noſtrils. This Symptom ſhe uſed to have ſo ordinarily, that the ſick Gentlewoman did not doubt but that this water ſtilled out from the brain it ſelf. I could here bring many other reaſons, which might ſeem to perſwade, that the Ventricles of the Brain, or the Cavity made by the complicature or folding up of its border, is a mere ſink of the excrementitious Humor; and that the humors there congeſted, are purged out by the Noſe and Palate: But it is time for us to haſten to other matters, and to paſs from the Brain, properly ſo called, to its Appendix, <hi>viz.</hi> the oblong Marrow and the Cerebel.</p>

                     <p>WE will paſs now from the Brain to the explication of its Trunk, to which both it and the Cerebel do grow like Muſhrooms or large Excreſcences. This part is commonly called the Oblong Marrow; under which name we comprehend all that ſubſtance which reaches from the inmoſt Cavity of the callous Body, and conjuncture in the Baſis of the Head, to the hole of the hinder part of the Head; where the ſame ſubſtance, being yet farther continued, ends in the ſpinal Marrow.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperficies of the oblong Marrow, though it be made unequal with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances and proceſſes, yet it is not variegated or garniſhed with any turnings about, and involutions, as it is in the Brain and Cerebel; neither is its exterior and cortical ſubſtance, or of an Aſh-colour, and the interior, medullar or marrowy and white; but all its frame or ſubſtance is in a ſort marrowy or medullous: nor does it however appear pure and bright, but much darkened with fibres and hairs vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtretched forth, and diverſly going out. To wit, its fibres being figured in various places, after a diverſe manner, in ſome places they are found chamſered, and as it were beamy, in others direct or ſtretched out at length, and in other places again circular.</p>
                     <p>The figure of this is forked, and as it were like the Poets <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> ſeems like the ter Y: for its ſhanks ariſing more forward from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The oblong Marrow ſeems to be a broad or high Road, into which the animal Spirits perpetually flow from their double Fountain, to wit, the Brain and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, to be derived from thence into all the nervous parts of the whole Body: which Spirits, whilſt they are orderly diſpoſed in this common paſſage, as it were by ſeries and orders, carry a twofold aſpect; to wit, they are directed either outward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Nerves, when they exert the loco-motive Faculty, or they look inward towards their Fountains, when the acts of ſenſe, or rather the apprehenſions of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things are performed.</p>
                     <p>Within this open way, a more large and greatly open path leads ſtraight to the ſpinal Marrow, through which the Spirits flow forth to the Nerves, the Executors of ſpontaneous Motion in moſt members. In the mean time, out of the ſame tract of the oblong Marrow, leſſer paths are carried outwardly, here and there, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nerves, ariſing from the ſame, within the Skull. Alſo beſides, many diverting places, <hi>viz.</hi> various proceſſes and protuberances grow to this medullary Trunk, into which, the Spirits deſtinated to ſome peculiar offices, go apart: leſt that all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits travelling this way and that way in the ſame path, ſhould meet one another and diſturb one anothers offices.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt after this manner, for the performing the acts of Motion and Senſe, we ſuppoſe the animal Spirits to be expatiated within the oblong Marrow; we affirm, that they are not there begotten, but only exerciſed. For indeed, they being created only in the Brain and Cerebel, as they proceed from this or that, they perform the offices, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Where the callous Body is thought to end, the oblong Marrow begins; to wit, when the medullar ſubſtance of the Brain is thickeſt nigh the boſſes or knobs of either Hemiſphere, a body of a whitiſh colour and ſomewhat darkned or obſcured, and ſtreaked like Ivory, is joyned to that marrow on both fides.

Either of theſe ſeems as it were a Cylinder rolled about into an Orb, which nevertheleſs conſtitutes the top of either ſhank, not ſpherical, but oval, and ſomething bent downward in the hinder part. A more large portion of its ſuperficies is joyned to the medullar ſubſtance of the Brain; but yet ſome part of it, being free from the coheſion with the Brain, ſhews it ſelf apart, and makes that protuberance ſhewing it ſelf in either lateral Ventricle. Theſe bodies, if they ſhould be diſſected along through the middle, appear marked, with medullar ſtreaks, as it were rays or beams: which ſort of chamferings or ſtreaks have a double aſpect or tendency; to wit, ſome deſcend from the top of this body, as if they were tracts from the Brain into the oblong Marrow; and others aſcend from the lower part, and meet the aforeſaid, as if they were paths of the Spirits from the oblong Marrow into the Brain.

                        </gap>, the firſt Senſory that receives the ſtrokes of all ſenſible things, dilated from the Nerves of every Organ, and ſo cauſes the perception of every ſenſe; which kind of ſtrokes of ſenſible things, when from hence they are paſſed further into the Brain, preſently Imagination ſucceeds the Senſe: and further, theſe bodies, as they receive the forces of all the Senſes, ſo alſo the firſt inſtincts of ſpontaneous local motions. To wit, as often as the Appetite diſcerns any thing to be done, preſently the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal tendencies of the animal Spirits, that is, from the Brain into theſe parts, are diſpoſed here to act the conceptions of motions coming from any part or member. For here, as in a moſt famous Mart, the animal Spirits, preparing for the performance of the thing willed, are directed into appropriate Nerves. That it is ſo, it appears, becauſe every influence from the Brain into the nervous ſtock, and on the contrary, from this into that, and the mutual commerce of the animal Spirits, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs through theſe bodies. Wherefore all the Nerves, alſo thoſe which belong to the more inward Organs of the Senſes, ariſe behind theſe chamfered bodies. For the Optick and ſmelling Nerves creep through the ſuperficies of the Brain by a long paſſage and windings about, that they might be inſerted below this part of the oblong Marrow.</p>
                     <p>For indeed, the Species of ſenſible things, received by thoſe Nerves, might more immediately be carried to the middle of the Brain, unleſs that they ought firſt to be ſtaid at this Senſory. Further, we may lawfully conjecture, that theſe parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the aforeſaid office from their chamfered, and as it were beamy contexture: For as thoſe chamſerings, with which theſe bodies are marked, (as we but now inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) are of a double kind, to wit, ſome deſcending, which look from the Brain towards the oblong Marrow; and others aſcending, which are carried diſtinctly from this towards that, it may be lawfully concluded, that in theſe carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the impreſſions of ſenſible things are perceived: and in thoſe tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are performed the Inſtincts of Motions.</p>
                     <p>Further, that theſe bodies, as was ſaid, perform the offices of the firſt Senſory, beſides the fabrick of their parts, and the Analogy to be collected thence of their uſe, it ſeems yet more certainly to appear from ſome Obſervations concerning theſe chamfered bodies, after what manner they are affected in Paralytick diſeaſes. For as often as I have opened the bodies of thoſe who dyed of a long Palſie, and moſt grievous reſolution of the Nerves; I always found theſe bodies leſs firm than others in the Brain, diſcoloured like filth or dirt, and many chamferings obliterated. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Whelps newly littered, that want their ſight, and hardly pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap> the other faculties of motion and ſenſe, theſe ſtreaks or chamſerings, being ſcarce wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, appear only rude.</p>
                     <p>The chamfered Bodies, inclining one to another near their blunt and greater angles, are almoſt contiguous; but that the Trunk of the <hi>Fornix</hi> intervenes with its twofold Root: yet in that place where the two Roots of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> being ſent ſtraight down, are inſerted into the callous Body, a tranſverſe medullar proceſs, like a great Nerve, ſtretched from one chamfered body to the other, as it were joyns the ſame, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107014:78"/>makes them to communicate one with the other. Certainly, this joyning together of the chamfered bodies is made, that their actions and paſſions may not be double: but though the ſpecies of the ſenſible object or conceptions of the motions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, coming from the Brain or Senſory being double, are carried alſo double to the firſt Senſory; yet for as much as either ſubſtance or frame of this, communicates with the other, every impreſſion coming this or that way, becomes ſtill one and the ſame. For it may be obſerved, in the whole Head, that though almoſt all things are double, yet each of them communicate among themſelves, either by a contiguity, or by proceſſes ſent forth. And ſo as by the duplication of it, care is taken againſt the abſolute privation or defect of the act, ſo the joyning together of its duplicature provides againſt the empty or confuſe multiplication of the ſame ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>After this manner, the chamfered bodies in Man and four-footed Beaſts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly found of the ſame ſpecies or form, and in every one of them, figured after the ſame manner; and are as it were the Joynts that joyn the Brain to the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow. But we have already ſhewn, that in Fowls and Fiſhes, whoſe brains being alike, differ from thoſe of men and four-footed beaſts, the thing is ſomewhat otherwiſe: For in Fowls the callous body is wanting to the brain; but what ſerves inſtead of it, is found in the oblong Marrow, to wit, two little Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſhew themſelves nigh the chambers of the Optick Nerves, which are arched or chamber'd with a whitiſh ſubſtance, ſuch as the callous body is in man or four-footed beaſts. Then on the contrary, the chamfered bodies, or the parts which ſerve in their ſtead, in Fowls, are not a portion of the oblong Marrow after the uſual manner, but are entred into the Brain it ſelf. For near the fiſſure of the Brain, two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes being marked with medullar chamferings, both diſtinguiſh either Hemiſphere of the Brain, and cover over its Ventricles. The ſtreaks or rays of either Membrane deſcend, and being concentred about the Baſis of the Brain, go together into a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary proceſs, which is inſerted on both ſides to the oblong Marrow. So theſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the callous body, in which the animal Spirits are expanded, and the chamfered bodies, in which their paſſing to and fro is inſtituted, ſeem to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the head of Fowls. The reaſon whereof, (as I elſewhere hinted) unleſs I be deceived, is this: becauſe theſe Animals are of leſs excellency in Imagination and Memory than four-footed beaſts; yea alſo, for that the ſenſe and motion of them are their chief Faculties: therefore for the exerciſes of theſe to be performed with a greater expanſion of Spirits, the callous body is transferred into the oblong Marrow, and in its place the chamfered bodies are removed into the Brain.</p>
                     <p>About the lower end of either chamfered body the ſmelling Nerves are inſerted. For you may take notice, that the mammillary Proceſſes, a little more obſcure in man, but much more conſpicuous in brute Animals, who are endued with a more remarkable ſenſe of ſmelling, do paſs into firm and plainly whitiſh bodies of Nerves, which being dilated or brought nigh the lateral turnings and windings of the Brain, are implanted into the oblong Marrow on either ſide about the lower angle of either Ventricle behind the chamfered bodies; yet ſo, that the Tube or Pipe of either Nerve may open into the Cavity of the Ventricle, as we before ſhewed. After this manner theſe Nerves are carried by a long journey from the fore part of the Brain, that they may bring the ſenſible ſpecies to the chamfered body, as to the common Senſory, firſt and rather than to the Brain. But we ſhall ſpeak of the ſmelling Nerves more particularly hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Where theſe chamfered Bodies end from either ſide, a marrowy ſubſtance ſucceeds, which being ſomewhat of a darkiſh colour going forward for ſome ſpace, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a peculiar bending forward from the other contiguous parts. This <hi>Galen</hi> (perhaps not improperly) calls the Chambers of the Optick Nerves; for in this place the Optick Nerves ſhewing themſelves from the higheſt region of either ſide, being carried downward with a certain compaſs, are united about the Tunnel. Then being divided again, and carried a little further, enter the Skull, going ſtraight forwards to either Senſory. The growing together of theſe Nerves, and their being again ſeparated, ſeems to be ordained for this end, that the viſible ſpecies, received from either Eye, might appear ſtill the ſame, and not double; for this conjunction of the twofold Organ frames the double image into one; which once united, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is carried to either ſide of the common Senſory, for that it is on both ſides alike, appears ſtill the ſame. If at any time, through drunkenneſs, or a diſtortion of the Eyes, the object appears double, and two Lights upon a Table, it is becauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107014:79"/>the image of the ſame thing is received after a different manner by one Eye than the other, for that reaſon the objects are repreſented like two diſtinct things. For that this Eye is diſtorted after one manner, and that after another, the ſame Species, coming to either Pupil by a diverſe angle of incidence, appears diverſe or double. There is another reaſon of the coalition of the Optick Nerves, to wit, that one Eye being hurt, all the viſible animal Spirits might be beſtowed on the other. Further, for that theſe Nerves are carried with a long paſſage, their uniting helps to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength and ſupport.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Optick Nerves ariſe here from the oblong Marrow, all or its moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſubſtance is not beſtowed upon them; but theſe Nerves are inſerted into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar Trunk, as branches of a Tree to the ſtock, that ſo they may receive by that means the influence of the Spirits, and by this way tranſmit the Species of viſible Things. In the mean time, this more inward ſubſtance of the oblong Marrow is the common paſſage both to the Eyes and to the other nervous Syſtem ariſing more backward: through which, by the going and returning to and fro of the animal Spirits, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of ſenſible things, and the inſtincts of Motions between the Brain and the other nervous parts, which depend upon it, are performed. Foraſmuch as the ſmelling and ſeeing Nerves ariſe ſo near the chamfered bodies, the reaſon hence is plain, why odors or the objects of the ſenſe of ſmelling ſo ſtrike the Brain it ſelf, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affect it; alſo why there is ſo exceeding ſwift a communication between Sight and Imagination.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Optick Nerves in a man, (which alſo in ſome meaſure is after the ſame manner in other living Creatures) we ſhall advertiſe you, that when they, after their uniting or mixing together, being preſently again ſeparated, do go out of the Skull, the ſanguiferous Veſſels going out of the Skull with them, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either Nerve even to the Baſis of the Eye, are knit into the Trunk of either. There is a noted ſhoot of the Artery deſtinated to this office, carried from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior branches of the <hi>Carotides.</hi> Hence, as I ſuppoſe, a reaſon may be given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when by drinking or more plentiful eating, a ſleepineſs is cauſed, preſently a great heavineſs, and as it were an oppreſſion, is felt about the Eyes. For when the blood, very much boiling up, fills above meaſure the Veſſels watering the Brain, and by diſtending them, obſtructs the Pores of the Brain, thoſe Nerves alſo from the blood in like manner boiling up within the Optick Veſſels, are preſſed together in their whole paſſage.</p>
                     <p>In Fowls and Fiſhes this chamber of the Optick Nerves, bunching out with a great bulk, is not much leſs than the Brain it ſelf; for, as we but now intimated, what is inſtead of the callous body is placed here; and in this place the animal Spirits ſeem to have their chief Mart or Empory in a moſt large medullar chamber, or the Sphere of their Expanſion. And ſo, when from hence the animal Spirits are derived from ſo full and plentiful a Store-houſe, it is for that reaſon Fowls are furniſhed with ſo curious an Eye, and with ſo highly perſpicacious and acute a ſight. And the ſame perhaps may hold concerning Fiſhes, if that we conſider the ſight in theſe is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a thicker Medium, and often double.</p>
                     <p>In ſome Animals, in the midſt of theſe chambers of either Optick Nerve, the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow a little opening, leave a chink or aperture, which receiving the ſeroſities coming from every region of the Brain and its Appendix, ſends them through the Tunnel into the pituitary Glandula.</p>
                     <p>There is no need that we ſhould diſcourſe much here of the Tunnel and the pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Glandula, becauſe, already ſpeaking of the Ventricles of the Brain, or the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty ſpace left within its plicature, we fell occaſionally on the conſideration of both theſe; where we ſhewed, that the ſerous humors, which were wont to be heaped together within many places of the Brain and of its Appendix, do all ſlide down on every ſide from each angle and receſs of it into the ſteep opening of the Tunnel; and ſo there is a neceſſity that they ſhould be poured out by it into the pituitary Glandula. Further, it is manifeſt, that this Glandula, in ſome Animals, is charged with a double office; to wit, as it receives the ſeroſities ſent from above from the Brain, ſo alſo it ſeparates the humors from the blood brought to the ſame from the wonderful Net by the Arteries, and prepoſſeſſing them, imbibes them before their ingreſs to the Brain. Wherefore this part is furniſhed with a ſubſtance of a double kind: <hi>viz.</hi> one reddiſh, more thin, and interwoven with Blood-carrying Veſſels, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes either ſide of it; and the other more white placed in the middle, to which the Tunnel is inſerted.</p>

                     <p>But having ſhewn, that this Glandula receives the humors ſo brought by a double Tribute, we did diligently inquire concerning the ways and means whereby they are at length carried away from thence: and as it appears by an Experiment, that there is a paſſage open from this Glandula into the Veſſels lying underneath the bone, and from thence into the Jugular Veins, we affirmed, that 'twas moſt likely, that the humors to be carried away from this Glandula, (after the manner of others) may be reduced at laſt into the bloody maſs. I ſhall not add any more concerning theſe things, but proceed to the other parts of the oblong Marrow.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Uſes of the Pineal Glandula and the Choroeidal Infolding; alſo of the orbicular Prominences which are commonly called</hi> Nates <hi>and</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes; <hi>and other Parts which ſeem to be dependences of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BElow the Chambers of the Optick Nerves in a common Valley which lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the tops of theſe and the Buttock-form Prominences, is placed the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Glandula or Kernel in form of a Pine apple, called alſo <hi>Conarium;</hi> this is not only found in Man and four-footed beaſts, but Fowls and Fiſhes alſo are endued with the ſame. Wherefore, although from hence it may be concluded, that this is of neceſſary uſe; yet we can ſcarce believe this to be the ſeat of the Soul, or its chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to ariſe from it; becauſe Animals, which ſeem to be almoſt quite deſtitute of Imagination, Memory, and other ſuperior Powers of the Soul, have this Glandula or Kernel large and fair enough.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved in all Animals of every kind and form, that to this Glandula, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways placed nigh the holes or paſſages, open to the Tunnel, the Choroeidal Infolding is continually joyned; yea this infolding (ſeeming to hang from the Pineal Kernel ſuſtaining its middle Proceſs, as it were by a nail or haſp, from thence) is divided into two wings ſtretching out on either ſide upon the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, Wherefore we may juſtly ſuſpect, that this Glandula is chiefly made for the ſake of this infolding; and that the office of it is no other than of other Kernels, which are placed nigh the concourſe of the ſanguiferous Veſſels: to wit, that it may receive and retain within it the ſerous humors depoſited from the arterious blood, till the Veins being emptied, may ſup them back, or the Lymphaeducts (if there be any there) may convey them outwardly. For it is obſerved, that the Choroeidal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding is beſet with very many leſſer Glandula's or Kernels, and every where inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with them, which imbibe the Serum ſecreted from the blood, in the ſmaller Veſſels; therefore for this very ſame office, where all the Veſſels concur, this Kernel is placed, of a bigger bulk, that it might be able to receive and contain the ſeroſities there plentifully depoſited. Moreover, it is of no ſmall moment, that this Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula ſuſtains and keeps duly ſtretched out the <hi>Chroeidal</hi> infolding otherwiſe hanging looſe, and apt to fall down into it ſelf, or at leaſt to ſlide out of its proper place. Wherefore I have often taken notice in the Dropſie of the Brain, that this <hi>Glandula</hi> being looſned at the roots by too much moiſture, and often broken off, and removed from its place, the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding hath ſlid together from its proper expanſion, and ſlip'd down lower, and alſo ſuffered its Veſſels to be folded together diſorderly.</p>
                     <p>From theſe things thus premiſed concerning the pineal Glandula, it will not be difficult to aſſign alſo the uſe of the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding: Concerning which there will be little need to reſel that Opinion of the common ſort, which aſſerts, That the animal Spirits, to be beſtowed upon the whole Brain, are begot in this infolding: becauſe the Veſſels of this inſtil nothing to the ſubſtance of the Brain or its Appendix, for that they are no where inſerted to it; but it was before ſhewn, that the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain, or the Cavity in which theſe ſame Veſſels are hung, do not at all contain the Spirits; which further appears more plain, becauſe in Cephalick diſeaſes thoſe Ventricles are filled with water, and the continuity of the infolding is diſſolved by too much moiſture, when in the mean time the ſick are indifferently ſtrong in the exerciſe of the animal Faculties.</p>
                     <p>But indeed we ſuppoſe, that this infolding ſerves for a twofold office: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that the more watry part of the blood, deſtinated for the Brain, might be ſent away into its Veſſels, to the end, that the remaining portion of the bloody <hi>Latex</hi> might become more pure and free from dregs to be diſtilled forth into Spirits; even as is wont to be done in a Chymical Diſtillation, to wit, when there is a peculiar Receiver fitted for the receiving of the Phlegm by it ſelf, more ſincere, pure, and ſubtil Spirits are inſtilled into the other more noted Receiver. The more watry blood entring the arterious Veſſels of this Infolding, being carried from them into the Veins, is remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back towards the Heart. In the mean time, leſt the Serum, too much redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107014:81"/>and boiling up in theſe Veſſels, might hinder circulation, its ſuperfluities are received for ſome time both by the leſſer Glandula's thickly inſerted, and alſo by the pineal Kernel.</p>
                     <p>The other and no leſs noted uſe of this Infolding, is to conſerve the heat of the blood boiling within the complications of the Veſſels, and as it were circulating about, being excited as from a fire-place within the infolding of the Brain. For though the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> need not implant thick ſhoots of Veſſels in the callous Body and inward Marrows of the Brain, for that they are rather dedicated to the Exerciſe than to the Generation of the animal Spirits; yet that the heat requiſite for the circulation of the Spirits, might be kept conſtantly in that place, this infolding is hung upon the whole neighbourhood. For as the blood, aggeſted or heaped together within the Cavities of the Boſoms, is inſtead of an hot Bath, whereby the animal Spirits are diſtilled plentifully into the outmoſt and cortical part of the brain; ſo the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the ſmall Veſſels of this infolding, ſeems to be in the place of a leſſer and more temperate Bath, whereby the ſame Spirits might be fitly circulated in the more inward and medullar ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Another reaſon may alſo be given, why the Choroeidal infolding is found always within the Ventricles or Cavity of the Brain, made by its infolding, and after what manner ſoever figured; to wit, that another ſort of commodity might reſult from thence; that when the Veſſels of that Infolding, carrying too watry blood, lay aſide more Serum than the Glandula's are able to receive or contain, what is ſuperfluous might ſlide down opportunely into the underlying Cavity, as into a Sink. Wherefore the <hi>Pineal Glandula,</hi> though ſet in a more eminent place, is however placed always near the hole or paſſage that lyes open towards the Tunnel in every brain.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Pineal Kernel are found in the upper ſuperficies of the oblong Marrow certain noted Prominences, which are commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes.</hi> Theſe being placed near together, do conſtitute as it were four Mole-hills, which yet are joyned one to another by certain proceſſes. Beneath theſe Mole-hills, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joyning of them and the trunk of the oblong Marrow, placed underneath, a narrow and long Cavity or Den is left, which by ſome Anatomiſts is called the fourth Ventricle; but according to others later, who place the fourth Ventricle under the Cerebel, this Cavity is affirmed to be a paſſage to it.</p>
                     <p>The hinder extremity of this Den ends nigh the beginning of the fourth Ventricle; the more fore-extremity of it opens before the former Mole-hills or little bulkings out, called <hi>Nates.</hi> From the midſt of this Cavity or narrow Den a paſſage goes ſtraight to the Tunnel. It is very much controverted among Anatomiſts concerning the ſite of theſe parts, and of their dependency on one another, and of other parts, and of their uſe: Concerning which this is firſt to be noted, as we hinted above, that theſe four Protuberances are far greater in ſome brute Animals than in a Man, as in a Sheep, Calf, Goat, and the like; alſo in a ſound, dry, and old Head they are more conſpicuous, and their proceſſes, joynings, and habitudes may be more eaſily noted than in a younger, moiſt, or otherwiſe ſickly brain. Indeed the uſe of theſe (unleſs my conjecture deceives me) ſeems far more noble, than that they ſhould deſerve thoſe vile names of <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> Buttocks and Teſticles.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, to what office theſe parts were deſigned, neither have the ancient Anatomiſts delivered, nor will it, by the help of Reaſon, be eaſie to gueſs for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We have already ſhewn, that theſe aforeſaid Prominences ought not to be taken for the two ſhanks either of the Brain or Cerebel bending back one towards another, and ſo growing together into the oblong Marrow. For although from this ſuppoſition a very neat Hypotheſis may be made for the oeconomy of the animal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, by affirming that theſe double ſhanks, on either ſide, were ſo many diſtinct ways of paſſage through which the animal <hi>Spirits,</hi> for the performing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, flowed from the Brain and Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, and returned thence from this into thoſe for the performing the acts of the Senſes: yet from our Method of Diſſecting it plainly appears, that the brain is not fixed to the oblong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row nigh this place, but far above it; ſo that indeed the anterior Prominences, unleſs mediately only, <hi>viz.</hi> by the chamfered bodies, receive not any portion of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar ſtock, or any influence from the brain, nor can have any dependency from it. Beſides, if the Protuberances called <hi>Nates</hi> were ſhanks of the brain, why ſhould the ſame be in man, (he having got the greateſt brain, the leaſt) or at leaſt leſſer than
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107014:82"/>in moſt other living Creatures? Then between the Prominences called <hi>Teſtes</hi> and the Cerebel, although there happens a certain communication; yet it ſeems that there lyes open a paſſage from thoſe little lumps into the Cerebel, and not from this, through them into the oblong Marrow. For out of theſe aforeſaid Prominences a medullar Proceſs aſcends obliquely on either ſide into the Cerebel, by whoſe paſſage the animal Spirits, tending from one ſtage to the other, cauſe a mutual commerce between thoſe parts and the Cerebel: But indeed the Proceſſes which lead from the Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, and carry to it its influences, being diſtinct from the former, ſtand ſomewhat lower, as ſhall be more clearly ſhewn hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak of the Cerebel.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, concerning the offices and uſes to which the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances ſerve, we ſhall make this conjecture. The animal Spirits perpetually flow out and leap back again from the fountain the brain into the oblong marrow, ſo that there may be had a conſtant commerce between the brain and many organs of ſenſe and ſpontaneous motion: from which thoſe parts are entertained which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their actions, not at the beck of the Appetite, but either by the inſtinct of Nature, or the blind impulſe of the Paſſions; for ſuch receive wholly their influences from the Cerebel, as afterwards ſhall be more fully ſhewed. Whilſt therefore the Spirits, flowing from the brain, abound in the oblong marrow, it is fit that ſome of them ſhould be carried from thence into the Cerebel: (for what uſes this ought to be done, ſhall be told by and by) wherefore from either ſide of the oblong marrow a Protuberance grows forth, into which indeed the Spirits deſigned for the Cerebel, may go apart from the common paſſage of the oblong marrow; and theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences are the former, which are commonly called <hi>Nates,</hi> and, as we have ſaid, are far greater in moſt brute Animals than in man (the reaſon of which ſhall be declared anon.) The other hinder Protuberances, commonly called <hi>Teſtes,</hi> grow to theſe former, and are only certain Epiphyſes or Excreſcences of them, as it were the heads of the medullary Proceſſes, which are from thence carried by an oblique aſcent into the Cerebel; for when the animal Spirits aſcend from the former Prominences into the Cerebel, they enter theſe latter firſt, as it were the more large beginnings or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances of their paſſage, from whence they go forward by the paſſage of the medullar Proceſſes into the Cerebel.</p>
                     <p>Beſides we may take notice, that when the animal Spirits are carried out of the oblong marrow into the greater natiform Prominences to be derived towards the Cerebel, they, according to their cuſtom, (as often as they tend towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſory from a double Organ of any Faculty) ought to be confounded and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together before they enter the Cerebel: wherefore both the firſt Prominences, and alſo the ſecond growing to them are joyned together with certain Proceſſes like wings reaching one another; which connexion indeed of them, becauſe it ought to be diſtinguiſhed every where from the medullar Trunk lying under it hence, from the ſeparation or empty ſpace that comes between the oblong marrow and the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the Prominences, that cavity ariſes, which is by ſome called the fourth Ventricle, and by others the paſſage to it.</p>
                     <p>If it be yet farther inquired, to what end the animal Spirits are carried by this by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſage from the common paſſage of the oblong marrow into the Cerebel, and thence back again; I ſay, that this is done for a twofold reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> both that the Paſſions or Affections of the ſenſitive Soul, begun from the brain, may be tranſmitted to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> then ſecondly, that the natural Inſtincts, excited in the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> might be communicated to the brain. Theſe reciprocal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces which are had between the brain and the Organs of involuntary Functions, ought to be inſtituted or performed by this private paſſage, leſt otherwiſe the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe involuntary Faculties ſhould very much diſturb the acts of the outward Senſes, or the intentions of ſpontaneous motions.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, it is obſerved, that by every paſſion of the ſenſitive Soul, as from Anger, Sadneſs, Pleaſure, and other Affections, the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are diſturbed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no; which variouſly dilate or conſtrain themſelves, and ſo ſtir up in the blood divers fluctuations. Moreover, from this kind of force of the Paſſions the countenance or the aſpects of the Face are wont to be altered and diſtorted after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways. The reaſon of all theſe ſeems to be, becauſe when the animal Spirits, exiſting within the brain, are moved according to the Idea of the conceived Paſſion, the other Spirits alſo flowing within theſe diverting places, being in like manner
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107014:82"/>moved, affect the Cerebel, and that coming between, the original of the Nerves, ſerving to the <hi>Praecordia, Viſcera,</hi> and Muſcles of the Face, and ſo the parts to which thoſe Nerves are diſtributed, are alſo ſtirred up or provoked into motions anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame paſſion.</p>
                     <p>But the aforeſaid Prominences and their dependences ſerve no leſs alſo for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of the impreſſions of natural Inſtincts to the Brain, that from thence the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and local motions might preſently be retorted: by which all the exigencies or wants perceived by the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera</hi> might be ſupplied. When in a young one newly born the ſtomach crys out for hunger, the Inſtinct of this is carried by the paſſage of the Nerves to the Cerebel, and from thence by the medullar Proceſſes to theſe Protuberances; and the Spirits there inhabiting, form the Idea of the impreſſion, and carry it to the brain, wherein preſently, without any previous knowledge or experience, ſuch kind of conceptions of the Soul are ſtirred up, that every little living Creature preſently ſeeks out the Mothers breaſts and ſucks.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, it does not ſeem of neceſſity we ſhould ſuppoſe theſe kind of acts of the Paſſions and Inſtincts to be made apart in this by-place; for why are not the commerces of the animal Spirits ordained by the influence from the Brain into the Nerves leading to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and ſo back again through the common paſſage of the oblong Marrow? But to that it may be readily anſwered, That this reciprocal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits ought to be made through the middle region of the Cerebel, from one ſtage to another for the exerciſe of theſe Faculties: And therefore (ſince that all manner of communication between the Brain and Cerebel is performed by theſe Prominences) there ſhould alſo be had a paſſage by the ſame way between this and the Organs of the Functions merely natural. Beſides, if the rage or furious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Paſſions and Inſtincts ſhould be carried in the ſame path in which the forces of ſenſible things are carried, their acts might be greatly confounded by the mutual meeting or gathering together of the animal Spirits. But this kind of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis concerning the Acts and Progreſs of the Paſſions and natural Inſtincts, ſhall be made more clear afterwards, when we deſign the Actions and Uſes of the Cerebel, and of the other parts, which in like manner ſeem to be deſtinated to the ſame offices with theſe Protuberances.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, what we have affirmed, that the latter Prominences are only Additionals or Excreſcences of the former, will clearly appear to any one beholding them. But this, as we have already hinted, is ſeen without Controverſie in the brains of a Calf, a Sheep, and ſome other four footed beaſts; where, when the <hi>Nates</hi> are ſignally great, the <hi>Teſtes</hi> grow to the ſame in a very ſmall bulk. Further, that the medullary Proceſſes lead from theſe into the Cerebel, and convey the animal Spirits by this by-path, is ſo manifeſt, that none who hath carefully beheld theſe parts, can be able any further to heſitate or be doubtful of it. For indeed the little hairs or fibres wherewith theſe proceſſes, aſcending into the Cerebel, are marked, are otherwiſe figured and placed than thoſe which are beheld in the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs deſcending from the Cerebel towards the oblong Marrow.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, either pair of Prominences do not only communicate among themſelves mutually by their ſtretched out wings, but alſo another medullar Proceſs, going croſs wiſe, knits together the aforeſaid Proceſſes ſtretched out from thence into the Cerebel; and from this joyning together of them two ſmall Nerves are produced, which bending down on either ſide, and being carried forward, enter the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and ſo go ſtraight through it, till having reached to the moving Nerves of the Eyes, they go forth of the Skull at the ſame hole with them, going forward ſtraight to the Trochlear Muſcle of the Eye. Concerning theſe little Nerves it is obſerved, that when many others proceed from the ſides or the Baſis of the oblong Marrow, theſe ariſe from the aforeſaid Prominences in the bunching forth at the top. The reaſon of which, if I be not miſtaken, is this: We have affirmed, that theſe Prominences do receive and communicate to the Brain the natural Inſtinct delivered from the Heart and Bowels to the Cerebel; and on the other ſide, or back again, do transfer towards the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> by the mediation of the Cerebel, the forces of the Paſſions or Affections received from the Brain; but in either action the motion of the Eyes is affected with a certain manifeſt Sympathy. For if pain, want, or any other ſignal trouble afflicts the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> a dejected and caſt down aſpect of the Eyes will declare the ſenſe of its trouble: when on the contrary, in Joy, or any pleaſant Affection of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the Eyes are made lively and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107014:83"/>ſparkle again. In like manner, the Eyes do ſo clearly ſhew the Affections of the Mind, as Sadneſs, Anger, Hatred, Love, and other perturbations, that thoſe who are affected, though they ſhould diſſemble, cannot hide the feeling and intimate conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the mind. Without doubt theſe ſo happen, becauſe the animal Spirits, tending this way and that way in this diverting place between the Brain and the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> do at once ſtrike thoſe Nerves as the ſtrings of a Harp. Wherefore from this kind of conjecture which we have made concerning the uſe of theſe Nerves, we have called them Pathetical, although indeed other Nerves alſo may deſerve this name.</p>
                     <p>There yet remains for us to take notice of the aforeſaid Prominences, that either of theſe pairs, and the Proceſſes hanging on them, are diſtinguiſhed from the trunk of the oblong Marrow lying under by the Cavity between them; ſo that this Cavity or Ventricle ſeems to exiſt only ſecondarily, becauſe the empty ſpace between the aforeſaid bodies, placed above and beneath, ſeparating the ſame one from another, ought to come between. But this Cavity ſeeming to reſult ſo by accident, hath a very ſignal uſe; for in the middle of its paſſage a ſloping aperture reaches towards the Tunnel, through which the humors ſliding into either of its holes, one made more forward, the other more backward, are ſent out. The more forward hole is placed between the chambers of the Optick Nerves, a little before the pineal Glandula, into which the ſerous heap being laid up nigh to the confines of the oblong Marrow, ſlides by degrees: but the other hole is opened more backward into the fourth Ventricle which is planted under the Cerebel; which hole is covered with a thin Membrane, which girding about its mouth and that of the Cerebel, provides leſt the humors, derived from the fourth Ventricle, or the confines of the Cerebel, ſhould fall down any other way than into that hole; but if at any time that little hole be broken aſunder by a deluge of the Serum, the watry Latex ſliding down upon the Baſis of the oblong Marrow, overwhelms the origines of the Nerves, and ſo brings Convulſive diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and meltings, and not ſeldom deadly, of the vital Spirits, as I have obſerved in the bodies of many dying of Cephalick Diſeaſes.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving hitherto continued the former Tract of the oblong Marrow, which as it were the Kings High-way, leads from the Brain, as the Metropolis, into many Provinces of the nervous ſtock, by private receſſes and croſs ways; it follows now that we view the other City of the animal Kingdom. The ſituation of this being remote enough from the former, its kind of ſtructure is alſo different from it: yea it ſeems that there are granted to this, as to a free and municipal City, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Priviledges and a peculiar Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>The Cerebel is placed a little below the orbicular Prominences in the hinder part of the Head; where growing to the trunk of the oblong Marrow by a double little foot, it appears almoſt of a Spherical figure. Its ſuperior gibboſity coheres towards the ſuperficies to the border of the Brain by the intervention of the <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> but nevertheleſs it is intimately united to it, nor is there any immediate commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this or that or their parts. There hath been ſpoken enough already of the figure and ſituation of the Cerebel, and of its various Proceſſes, and how it is faſtned to the oblong Marrow; it now remains that we proceed to deſign or draw out the offices and uſes of it, and its ſeveral parts. Where in the firſt place ſhall be inquired into, what kind of office the Cerebel is endued with in the animal oeconomy; then when we ſhall deſcend to particulars, there are more things worthy to be noted, which will offer themſelves to our conſideration: <hi>viz.</hi> firſt the infoldings of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels covering the whole compaſs of the Cerebel, and eſpecially its hinder part, with the heap of Kernels: ſecondly, its folds and lappets ordained with a certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſeries, and almoſt after a like manner in all: thirdly, the double ſubſtance of the folds, <hi>viz.</hi> cortical and marrowy: and the concentring of all the medullary tracts in two large Marrows or middeſts: fourthly, either little foot or pedeſtal of the Cerebel made out of thoſe two middle Marrows: and in either pedeſtal three
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107014:83"/>diſtinct medullar Proceſſes to be found: fifthly, the annular Protuberance made by a proceſs of the Cerebel deſcending into the medullar Trunk: ſixthly, ſome Nerves, which ariſing immediately from this Protuberance and other Nerves in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, which being deſigned for the involuntary Function, receive the influences of the animal Spirits from the Cerebel: Laſtly, the Ventricle or Cavity lying under the Cerebel ought to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the office or uſe of the Cerebel in general: nothing of it occurs, ſpoken by the Ancients, worthy its fabrick, or agreeable to its ſtructure. Some affirm this to be another Brain, and to perform the ſame actions with it: but if any one ſhould have a ſoft and fooliſh Brain, I greatly doubt, if he ſhould become wiſe, though he ſhould obtain perhaps a more hard and ſolid Cerebel. Others place the Memory in this part, ſuppoſing the Cerebel to be as it were a Cheſt or Box, wherein the Idea's or images of things, before laid up, are kept apart from the incourſe of freſh Species. But it is far more probable, that this faculty reſides in the cortical ſpires of the Brain; as we have elſewhere ſhewn. For as often as we endeavour to remember objects long ſince paſt, we rub the Temples and the fore-part of the Head, we erect the Brain, and ſtir up or awaken the Spirits dwelling in that place, as if endeavouring to find out ſomething lurking there; in the mean time, there is perceived nothing of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour or ſtriving motion in the hinder part of the Head. Beſides, we have ſhewn, that the Phantaſie and Imagination are performed in the Brain; but the Memory depends ſo upon the Imagination, that it ſeems to be only a reflected or inverſe act of this: wherefore that it ſhould be placed with it in the ſame Cloiſter, to wit, in the Brain, is but neceſſary; for it plainly appears, that there is no immediate commerce between the Brain and the Cerebel.</p>
                     <p>When ſome time paſt I diligently and ſeriouſly meditated on the office of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and revolved in my mind ſeveral things concerning it, at length, from the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and frequent Ratiocination, this (as I think) true and genuine uſe of it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred; to wit, that the Cerebel is a peculiar Fountain of animal Spirits deſigned for ſome works, and wholly diſtinct from the Brain. Within the Brain, Imagination, Memory, Diſcourſe, and other more ſuperior Acts of the animal Function are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; beſides, the animal Spirits flow alſo from it into the nervous ſtock, by which all the ſpontaneous motions, to wit, of which we are knowing and will, are performed. But the office of the Cerebel ſeems to be for the animal Spirits to ſupply ſome Nerves; by which involuntary actions (ſuch as are the beating of the Heart, eaſie Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Concoction of the Aliment, the protruſion of the Chyle, and many others) which are made after a conſtant manner unknown to us, or whether we will or no, are performed. As often as we go about voluntary motion, we ſeem as it were to perceive within us the Spirits reſiding within the fore-part of the Head to be ſtirred up to action, or an influx. But the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel perform unperceivedly and ſilently their works of Nature without our knowledge or care. Wherefore whilſt the Brain is garniſhed as it were with uncertain Meanders and crankling turnings and windings about, the compaſs of this is furniſhed with folds and lappets diſpoſed in an orderly ſeries; in the ſpaces of which, as in deſigned Orbs and Tracts, the animal Spirits are expanded according to the Rule and Method naturally impreſſed on them. For indeed thoſe in the Cerebel, as it were in a certain artificial Machine or Clock, ſeem orderly diſpoſed after that manner within certain little places and boundaries, that they may flow out orderly of their own accord one ſeries after another without any driver, which may govern or moderate their motions. Wherefore foraſmuch as ſome Nerves perform ſome kind of motions according to the inſtincts and wants of Nature, without conſulting the government of the will or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite within the Brain, why may it not be imagined, that the influence of the Spirits is derived wholly from the Cerebel for the performing of theſe? For it ſeems inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that for theſe offices which ſhould be performed without any tumult or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Spirits ſhould be called out of the Brain, which are continually driven into fluctuations as it were with the winds of Paſſions and Cogitations.</p>
                     <p>As I only imagined of the uſe of the Cerebel after this manner, I was led to it at length by a certain thread of Ratiocination; to which afterwards happened an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical inſpection, which plainly confirmed me in this opinion. For in the frequent Diſſection of the Heads of ſeveral ſorts of Animals certain Obſervations did occur, which ſeemed to put this matter out of all doubt. For I firſt obſerved, the pairs of Nerves, which did ſerve to the Functions, wont to be performed by the Inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107014:84"/>or the force of the Paſſions, rather than by the beck of the will, ſo immediately to depend on the Cerebel, that from thence only the influence of the animal Spirits ſeems to be derived into their origines or beginnings. By what means the Nerves ariſing from the Cerebel, or receiving from it the proviſion of the animal Spirits, do perform only involuntary actions, ſhall be declared hereafter; in the mean time, for the confirmation of this Opinion, we have in readineſs another Reaſon of no leſs moment.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſecondly, we took notice, that not only the conformation or make of the Cerebel was ordained after a certain and peculiar manner, that is, that its frame or bulk was couched together with folds or little circles, diſpoſed in a certain diſtinct ſeries, and apt method, and proportionate within themſelves, as hath been ſaid; whence it may be argued, that the Spirits ariſing from hence, and flowing outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are imployed or beſtowed on ſome certain works determinate to one thing. But further it is obſerved, that in all Animals, although they differ in form and kind, yet the figure of the Cerebel is always very like or wholly the ſame. The Brain and oblong Marrow are figured in many after a divers manner; for as we have ſhewed before, there is ſome difference of theſe parts found in man and four-ſooted beaſts: but between either of theſe, and Fowls and Fiſhes, there is a notable difference as to theſe parts. Notwithſtanding in all theſe the Cerebel, furniſhed wholly with the ſame lappets or little circles alike infolded one in another, is marked with the ſame form and proportion; which certainly is a ſign that the animal Spirits in this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe are begotten and diſpenſed, as it were by a certain dimenſion, for certain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary offices, which are performed in all after the ſame manner; and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any other than the motions and actions of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and <hi>Pracordia.</hi> As to the other Faculties, of which ſort are Imagination, Memory, Appetite, yea local motions and ſenſe are exerciſed after one manner in thoſe living Creatures, and after another manner in others; wherefore their brains are formed after a divers manner. But the motions of the Heart and Reſpiration in all endued with an hot blood, are performed after a like manner, that is, with a perpetual viciſſititude of <hi>Syſtoles</hi> and <hi>Diaſtoles.</hi> Beſides, another office is to be aſſigned to the Cerebel, and different from what is convenient or agreeable to the Brain; becauſe where the folds and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are wanting in the Brain, they are conſtantly found in the Cerebel. Beſides theſe reaſons drawn from Anatomy, the Pathology of the humane Body affords many others, which confirm the aforeſaid office of the Cerebel. For it oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that cruel and horrid Symptoms infeſt the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the region of the middle or loweſt Belly; whilſt in the mean time, the morbifick cauſe lyes in the Cerebel or nigh its confines. I have known ſometimes men labouring only in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with a Dyſcraſie of the hinder part of the Head, who complained of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Swooning and repeated meltings of the Spirits or Deliquiums, as if they were juſt dying: in whom notwithſtanding nothing more could be detected of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick cauſe or its ſeat, but that the Patient perceived a great heavineſs and pain in the hinder part of the Head, and that upon any ſudden motion or bending back of the Head, they were ready to dye. In truth, the Symptoms which are wont to be raiſed up in the diſtemper called the <hi>Incubus</hi> or Night-mare, <hi>viz.</hi> loſs of ſpeech, and a mighty weight or load that ſeems to lye upon the breaſt, proceed altogether from the morbifick matter fixed in the confines of the Cerebel, and obſtructing the paſſages of the Spirits deſtinated for the <hi>Pracordia.</hi> But indeed this Hypotheſis of the office of the Cerebel ſhall be more illuſtrated and confirmed from the uſes of its ſeveral parts, being rightly deſigned or drawn forth.</p>
                     <p>As to the parts and accidents of the Cerebel, 1. we take notice, that the infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Veſſels every where cloath the Cerebel no leſs than the Brain, alſo that the ridges and furrows of its folds intimately hide or cover it, which certainly is a ſign that the animal Spirits are begotten in this other work-houſe of them from the watering blood, and inſtilled into its ſubſtance: which thing alſo more clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe the Arteries and Veins are not only variouſly complicated in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Cerebel, but both of them in like manner as in the Brain, ſend forth frequent ſhoots into its more inward ſubſtance; wherefore whilſt the moſt ſubtil and ſpirituous part of the blood being carried through long windings about, and as it were ſerpentine chanels of the Veſſels, and ſo ſublimed into Spirits is received within; the bloody part is carried away by the ſhoots of the Veins ſent alſo deeply down. Further, even as the more watry portion of the blood, deſtinated for the Brain, runs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107014:84"/>into the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding; (whereby it may there lay aſide its unprofitable Phlegm into the Glandula's) ſo for the ſake of ſeparating the Phlegm an heap of Glandula's, with the foldings of the Veſſels, as it were a Receptacle fitted for this buſineſs, is placed in the hinder region of the Cerebel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the blood, after this manner cleared from Phlegm, and made ſubtil by a long circulation, a very pure and ſpirituous liquor is inſtilled into the cortical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Cerebel, which is preſently exalted by the Ferment there placed into animal Spirits. For indeed we have affirmed, that the Spirits are procreated only in the cortical part of the Cerebel, as in that of the Brain: wherefore, becauſe this kind of Cortex is wanting to the oblong and ſpinal Marrow, we think theſe parts do ſerve only for the exerciſe of the animal Spirits, and not for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Spirits every where produced within the cortical or exterior compaſs of the Cerebel, in which they are preſently prepared for the work of the animal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are derived from all the folds into the medullar tract, and thence into two ample middle Marrows; where they keep full as it were the fountain or ſpring, and there like the bubling up of waters, are circulated within with a perpetual turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from thence they continually ſtream forth into the parts of the nervous Syſtem proper to themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As to the ways of Emanation it is obſerved, that the two middle Marrows of the Cerebel paſs as it were into two pedeſtals or little feet, by which they are faſtned to the trunk of the oblong Marrow; and for that in either little foot of it three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct medullar Proceſſes are found, all theſe, or at leaſt two of them, are as it were ſo many paths whereby the animal Spirits ſtream forth from their fountain and flow back again.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The firſt of theſe Proceſſes aſcends into the Cerebel from the orbicular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences: the uſe of this we have already declared; to wit, that there may be a certain paſſage between theſe Prominences and the Cerebel, in which, whilſt the animal Spirits, as in a by-path, move this way and that way, to and fro, they may tranſmit both the force of the Paſſions from the Brain by the interpoſition of the Cerebel to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and convey alſo the natural Inſtincts delivered to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> towards the Brain. But the ſecond Proceſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſtraight from the Cerebel, embraces the medullar Trunk, and ſo going round about it, conſtitutes the annular or ringy Protuberance, out of which the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh pair of Nerves take their originals; ſo indeed, that this Protuberance ſeems to be the Ware-houſe or Store-houſe of the Spirits flowing from the Cerebel, from which they may influence and be derived into the oppoſite paſſages of the Nerves. Laſtly, the third proceſs of either little foot, deſcending from the Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, is inſerted into its trunk over againſt where the eighth pair of Nerves have their original; ſo that it ſhould ſeem very likely, the proviſion of the Spirits deſtinated for this Nerve is derived alſo by this way from the Cerebel; then what Spirits ſuperabound, remaining longer than this Nerve requires, they ſliding down into the common belly or chanel of the oblong and ſpinal Marrow, increaſe the plenty of thoſe parts. For this ſame end the ſmooth and pyramidal bodies are reached out of the annular Protuberance above the oblong Marrow towards the Spine, to wit, that by the paſſage of thoſe Proceſſes the Spirits of that proviſion or ſtock ſuperabounding, might flow out partly into the beginning of the eighth pair, and partly into the common tract of the medullar Trunk.</p>
                     <p>Thus much we have ſpoken briefly and ſummarily of the Uſes of the Cerebel, and of its parts and Proceſſes. But that it may be the better underſtood, and alſo that this new thought of Theory concerning the involuntary Function of the animal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, may be more clearly illuſtrated, we ſhall here give you a more particular Order or Method of the Spirits brought forth in the Cerebel, and as it were take a view of, or muſter their Arms or Forces. Further, it will ſeem to the purpoſe, that we ſhould deſign or draw forth more openly the abundance or plenty of the Nerves receiving their gifts from this Fountain of the Spirits concerning the Acts to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed only of the involuntary Function.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter having ſhewn, that the office of the Cerebel is to procreate animal Spirits apart from the Spirits begotten in the Brain, and to diſpenſe them into the Nerves, the Executors of the involuntary Actions and Paſſions; there yet remains to be unſolded by what manner of oeconomy or government the Spirits inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the Cerebel and made free, are buſied both by an inteſtine Circulation, within their proper dwelling places, and alſo are wont to be expanded and flow out with an exterior irradiation for the neceſſities and wants of other parts: then theſe things being ſhewn, we ſhall deſign more particularly the Uſes and Offices of the Nerves, and of ſome other Proceſſes doing ſervice to this Government.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, as the Cerebel is the other primary Root of the ſenſitive Soul, or the Fountain from whence the animal Spirits, being diffuſed through the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it and its Appendix, are continued ſtill under the ſame Syſtaſis and radiant Contexture, it is to be noted, that this radiation of the Spirits from the Cerebel doth flow after another manner than the other from the Brain: becauſe this being left to it ſelf, is beſtowed by a conſtant efflux or flowing out on the Organs both of the vital Function and the merely natural, and its expences by an equal continual proviſion of Spirits, are made up again from the bloody maſs continually inſtilled in. But on the contrary, the Spirits flow out from the Brain, neither by ſuch a continual courſe without intermiſſion and by little and little, nor are ſuſtained by a perpetual proviſion and ſliding in by degrees; but both the loſs of them, and their refection, are uncertain, unequal, and variouſly interrupted. For neither are the ſpontaneous Acts of the Function it ſelf, to which they ſerve, performed after any conſtant or always the ſame manner; but according to exterior accidents and occaſions we put them forth by heaps, and with a certain force ſometimes, and again ſometimes we ſuffer them to be wholly intermitted and unimployed. Therefore the Spirits alſo are in like manner ſupplied with an uncertain meaſure; to wit, they are inſtilled in ſleep plentifully and more copiouſly, but waking more ſparingly and with hard labour, or ſcarce not at all. Yea the involuntary portion it ſelf of the ſenſitive Soul (which flows from the Cerebel) for that it hath a near commerce and affinity (as was already ſaid) with the other radicated in the Brain, therefore it is wont to be much diſturbed in the performing its office equally and peaceably, and being variouſly affected and agitated by the impulſes ſent here and there, or from this place and that, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, ſometimes to contract, ſometimes to extend its <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> in the whole or in part, and ſo is rendred obnoxious to ſeveral Paſſions, and ordinarily inſtigated to the performing irregular and diſorderly actions.</p>
                     <p>But indeed the contexture of the Spirits, or the part of the Soul irradiating the Cerebel and its Appendix, is both affected with a certain ſenſe, and is urged into motions appropriate to it ſelf, though divers. The ſenſe or Sympathy belonging to this, if it be terminated within the confines of the Cerebel, is always private, nor goes any farther forward to the Brain with a more ſtrong undulation or wavering; and becauſe it is performed the living Creature knowing nothing of it, unleſs by the effect it cannot be known, for that it excites a peculiar motion. But ſuch an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Cerebel is implanted in it, that by every new diſpoſition of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> communicated to this from beneath, alſo from every violent paſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited within the <hi>Forum</hi> of the Brain, and ſo ſent from above, a certain impreſſion is carried to the inhabitants of the Cerebel: by which indeed they are diſpoſed into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ordinations for the performing theſe or thoſe motions reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>For examples ſake, ſo long as the tranquil region of the Cerebel, like a ſerene and fair Heaven, is free from all perturbation, the Spirits its inhabitants, being poured out with a pleaſing ſenſe, or as it were a certain complacency, flow within their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per habitations, both with a gentle circulation, and alſo with an equal flowing out enter the beginnings of the Nerves ſerving to the Functions both vital and natural: by which indeed eaſie Reſpiration, the Pulſe, Chylification, and other offices of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107014:85"/>ſame nature, are performed peaceably. But if that any trouble or moleſtation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen outwardly to any one, from whence an impreſſion of it is communicated to the Cerebel, preſently a troubleſom ſenſe being ſtirred up there, it diſturbs the animal Spirits in the Fountain it ſelf, and ſo is wont to excite irregular motions in the Organs of the involuntary Function. For from hence the frequent alteration of the Pulſe and of Reſpiration, alſo Cramps of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and convulſive motions ariſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, or alſo againſt our wills. But an impreſſion ſent from elſewhere to the Cerebel, and inducing the ſame kind of troubleſom ſenſe, either aſcends by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Nerves from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or it is carried from above from the Brain by the paſſage of the orbicular Prominences; as ſhall be ſhewn more largely anon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, from theſe things already ſhewed of the paſſive power or ſenſe of the Cerebel, it may be eaſily collected, by what means, with what order and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the animal Spirits, ariſing from the ſame, are moved. But firſt you muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between their twofold motion. For one is cuſtomary and ordinary, conſiſting in a perpetual and equal efflux of Spirits; by which indeed, they flowing into the beginnings of the Nerves nigh their riſings, eſpecially of the intercoſtal and wandring pair, the ſolemn acts of the Pulſe, Reſpiration, Chylification, and others of the involuntary Function are performed. Then ſecondly, the other motion happens extraordinary and occaſional, which the ſame Spirits perform confuſedly, as it were in diſturbed orders: as when the Pulſe becomes quicker or ſlower than it ought, or the Reſpiration unequal or interrupted; and when the other Faculties, which belong to this Claſs, are perverted from their regular and conſtant manner. But theſe kind of extraordinary motions are again twofold, to wit, for that its inſtigation proceeds from a double bound; for the impulſe whereby the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel, are compelled into an irregular action, (as we have but now intimated) is carried either from beneath, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> or it is wont to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from above, to wit, from the Brain.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, if at any time the <hi>Praecordia</hi> grow too hot, and are burnt with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh heat, preſently by the paſſage of the Intercoſtals and the wandring pair of Nerves, the Spirits reſiding in the Cerebel, being warned of this evil, inſtitute more frequent and ſtronger acts both of the Pulſe and of Reſpiration. In like manner, if by chance the humors and ſharp Juyces irritate or greatly trouble or afflict the Coats of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles or Inteſtines through the ſenſe of this affection communicated to the Cerebel, the inſtinct of performing the motion is reciprocated, whereby the fibres of the parts, being contracted and wrinkled together, endeavour the ſhaking off of the hurtful matter. More inſtances might be here brought of all the other acts of the vital or merely natural Function: of which beſides it may be obſerved, that when a ſenſe of the trouble is immediately conveyed from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera</hi> to the Cerebel, this affection, like the waving of waters, is either ſtopt or terminated there, from whence a motion, as the buſineſs requires, unknown to the Brain, is preſently retorted, as when the actions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are altered by a feaveriſh diſtemper without our knowledge; or ſecondly, that ſenſe of the trouble being tranſmitted to the Cerebel, for that it is more vehement, it unfolds it ſelf more largely, and like a ſtronger wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of waters, paſſing through the Cerebel, goes forward further even to the Brain, and warns its inhabitants of the evil; by which they being incited to oppoſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cauſe a motion of another kind: So (as hath been ſaid) when the <hi>Praecordia</hi> grow cruelly hot, the Cerebel feeling this, makes the Pulſe and Reſpiration ſtronger. But further, the Brain being warned of the ſame trouble, ſeeks and diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires cold drink and other remedies to moderate the heat. Moreover, it is after this manner alſo in ſeveral other actions, which though they are regular, yet being made in the Brain without any previous knowledge, they are ſaid to be done by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts merely natural; as when brute Animals, being newly brought forth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeek for the Dams teats, and greedily ſuck; or Birds, without any ſhewing or example, build neſts with wonderful Art, lay eggs, and hatch young ones. In theſe kind of works the Brain being taught before by none, directs fit means to the ends inſtituted by Nature: which indeed ſeems to be done by this means. The ſenſe of every neceſſity being brought to the Cerebel, incites the Spirits inhabiting it to ſuccour it; which when they are not able to do, the impreſſion going from thence further forward, is carried to the orbicular Prominences: by which the Spirits there inhabiting, being preſently ſtruck, form the Appetite or the intention of performing,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107014:86"/>which being thence communicated to the Brain, it readily cauſes that local motions, fit for the executing of the work, be retorted. Of theſe we ſhall ſpeak anon a little more largely, when we treat of the reſpect which happens between the orbicular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences and the annular Protuberance.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, we ſhall take notice in the ſecond place, that the irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirits in habiting the Cerebel, are wont alſo, by reaſon of the force of the affections, to be tranſmitted from thence to the Brain: for as often as a violent paſſion, as Joy, Sadneſs, Anger, Fear, or of any other kind, is conceived in the Brain, preſently the impreſſion of the ſame being brought through the by-paths of the Prominences into the Cerebel, diſturbs the Spirits deſtinated to the vital or mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural Function in their very fountain, and for that reaſon preſently induces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table mutations in the Organs of thoſe Functions.</p>
                     <p>What hath been ſpoken hitherto of the Cerebel being imployed about the offices of the involuntary Function only, alſo concerning the ſenſe and the motions both uſual and irregular of the Spirits inhabiting it, will be made more clear, if laſtly we ſhall ſhew the offices of the Nerves and of the other proceſſes, immediately depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Cerebel, to be no other than ſuch as perform only involuntary Acts: which ſhall be briefly and ſuccinctly done, as far as is pertinent to our purpoſe, becauſe a more full conſideration of them is left to another place.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have already ſhewed, that out of the annular Protuberance (which is a certain Proceſs of the Cerebel) three pairs of Nerves, to wit, the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh immediately ariſe. We have ſaid that Protuberance to be as it were a Repoſitory or Store houſe, wherein the Spirits flowing out of the Cerebel, and to be derived into the depending Nerves, as occaſion ſerves, are kept: and in the mean time, whilſt they remain there, they who ſtream out from either middle Marrow of the Cerebel diviſively, meeting mutually in this Cirque, are united together. But as the aforeſaid three pairs of Nerves receive the forces of the Spirits from the Cerebel by the mediation of that Protuberance; ſo alſo the eighth pair ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its riſe near the inſertion of the other (<hi>viz.</hi> the loweſt) medullar Proceſs ſent down from the Brain, ſeems to derive by its paſſage the influence of the Spirits no leſs from the Cerebel: wherefore when theſe four conjugations of Nerves owe the Tribute of their Spirits wholly to the Cerebel, if I ſhall ſhew that all theſe Nerves ſerve chiefly and almoſt only to the involuntary acts of the Senſes and Motions, ſurely this will be a ſignal Argument, that according to our Hypotheſis, the office of the Cerebel is to beget and to diſpenſe the animal Spirits requiſite for the involuntary Functions.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the firſt place we obſerve of the fifth and ſixth conjugation of Nerves, that as this ariſes out of the Baſis of the greater Ring, and that from its ſides both in man and in four-footed beaſts; the fifth pair being carried more forward, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes its branches into the Glandula's of the Eyes, into the Noſtrils, into the Palate, Teeth, yea and into moſt parts of the Face and Mouth; but the ſixth pair is wholly beſtowed on ſome Muſcles of the Eyes. Further, out of the trunk of the fifth pair two ſhoots, and another out of the Nerve of the ſixth pair bending back behind, meet together; and what is wonderful, and not before taken notice of by Anatomiſts, the intercoſtal Nerves, deſtinated to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> do make a Trunk; ſo that the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair ſtretch out a double Ramification, to wit, one more above about the parts of the Mouth and Face, and the other lower through the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the middle and loweſt Belly. But it will appear clearly to any one conſidering this thing more carefully, that the chief branches of either partition are imployed about the involuntary offices of Motion and Senſe, of which ſort thoſe are chiefly, that either cauſe the paſſions, or perform the natural Inſtincts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concerning the intercoſtal Nerve, which (as was ſaid) being radicated in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107014:86"/>Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair, depends as to its origine wholly on the Cerebel, it is not here to be doubted but that it looking towards the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> in a man, and towards theſe latter only in moſt four-footed beaſts, is beſtowed on the Functions only vital and merely natural, and ſo confers little or nothing to ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous actions. Further, foraſmuch as this Nerverea ching forth into the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the whole Abdomen, is continued by its ſuperior ramification alſo into the Eyes, as alſo into the parts of the Mouth and Face; certainly from hence a true and genuine reaſon may be given wherefore in every paſſion the Eyes, Face, and Mouth do ſo correſpond with the affections of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> often unknown to us or againſt our minds, that oftentimes we are compelled to betray the moſt intimate ſenſe of the Heart by the countenance and aſpect. Yea, hence a reaſon may be brought, why in ſneeſing, yawning, laughing, and crying the Muſcles of the Face conſpire ſo in motion with the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> Beſides, when in man different from any other living Creatures beſides, as we ſhall ſhew afterwards, many ſhoots are ſent from the intercoſtal Nerve to the Nerve of the Diaphragma; this certainly is the cauſe why riſibility is the proper affection of man.</p>
                     <p>But the Trunk of the fifth pair being carried more forward, and diſtributing its branchings through the parts of the whole Face, cauſes the ſame not only to be pathetically moved, and figured according to the affections of the <hi>Pracordia;</hi> but alſo produces ſome acts, both of motion and ſenſation, of another kind, which for the moſt part are involuntary, and ſo ſeem to depend wholly upon the Cerebel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. For example, this Nerve imparts ſhoots to either mandible requiſite for the buſineſs of chewing: but it is very well known, that the taking in of the food at the mouth is the firſt and oldeſt buſineſs of every Animal, which indeed is taught by natural Inſtinct before any knowledge of the Brain. But as to the Senſes, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this pair conduce ſomething to the ſmelling, but for the moſt part for the knowing and chuſing of ſavors. Hence it comes to paſs, that as odors refreſh the Brain by the ſmelling Nerves, ſo alſo they affect the Cerebel by the branch of this pair, and are wont by that means to recreate the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi> But ſapors or taſtes (for that they are almoſt the peculiar Province of this) carry whatſoever they have of pleaſantneſs or trouble, firſt to the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel, and then by their conſent to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera.</hi> Hence it is, that a Pectoral not only allays hunger, but the very firſt taſting of Wine raiſes up thoſe that are fainting or ſwooning away. Moreover, foraſmuch as from this Nerve certain branches ſerve for the taſte, and others for the ſmell, there is contracted ſo ſtrict an affinity between either of theſe Senſories, that nothing pleaſes the taſte unleſs it be approved of by the ſmell: and the loſs of one of theſe ſenſes oftentimes cauſes the privation or the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Concerning the Nerve of the ſixth conjugation we obſerve, that as one ſhoot is bent back for a root of the intercoſtal Nerve, the remaining Trunk of it being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forward towards the ball of the Eye, is diſtributed to two of its Muſcles, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ſeventh, proper to beaſts, and to the drawing Muſcle. Hence may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this Nerve, beſides the influence of it beſtowed on the vital and natural Function, ſerves alſo for the producing ſome pathetick motions of the Eye, to wit, ſuch as are wont to obey the affections of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> ſo that the whole proviſion of the animal Spirit, which it receives from the Cerebel, it beſtows only on involuntary acts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſeventh pair, or the hearing Nerves, ſeem alſo to depend upon the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, foraſmuch as they take their originals out of the annular Protuberance: but the uſe of them is a little otherwiſe in man than in four-footed beaſts. For in him the annular Protuberance is one, and that very big, from whoſe lower margin the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Nerves proceed: but in Brutes the Protuberance is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> one greater, ſent down from the Cerebel, in which the beginnings of the fifth and ſixth pair of Nerves conſiſt; then near this there is another leſſer, and as it were ſecondary, from which the auditory Nerves proceed. This leſſer and lower Ring doth not ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly depend on the Cerebel, as the former; but there is ſtretched out from either height of it a white medullar line upon the oblong Marrow in the bottom of the fourth Ventricle: ſo as this ſeems to receive either the Spirits from the oblong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or at leaſt to carry into the ſame the ſenſible Species: for what uſe it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſhall be inquired into afterwards; for concerning theſe Nerves of the ſeventh pair, foraſmuch as ſome offices of them very much illuſtrate the government or oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107014:87"/>of the Cerebel, we ſhall diſcourſe here a little more largely.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in man, who hath got a great and undivided annular Protuberance, the auditory Nerves coming out of its margin or brim, ſhew its ſtock received of the Cerebel: by which means we may ſee the tasks of thoſe Nerves quadrate with the aſſigned government of this. We have ſhewn before the Proceſſes (which in a manner may be called diſtinct Nerves) of the ſeventh pair to be twofold on either ſide: one, the ſofter of theſe, ſerves only for the ſenſe, but the other harder ſeems to perform ſome motions. This latter Nerve, being carried without the Skull, is divided into three branches, all which ſerve to pathetick motions, or at leaſt to ſuch as are performed without conſulting the Brain.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt of them being bent back towards the auditory paſſage, is beſtowed on the Muſcles of the Ear. Without doubt, by the action of this, it is effected, that all Animals at the ſudden impulſe of a ſound or noiſe, erect their Ears at it were to catch the ſound too ſoon paſſing by. 2. The other branch of this ſame Nerve climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Muſcles of the Jaw, ſends forth ſhoots towards either corner of the Eye: which are inſerted into the Muſcles lifting up the Eye-lids; the office of which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to open ſuddenly the Eyes at the ſudden approach of any ſound, and as it were to call them forth to watch, that by the ſtroke of the Air being brought to the Ear, the Eye might preſently look about to ſee what is the matter, and whether there might be any danger near or not: which alſo all Creatures do unthought of. 3. The third branch of the ſame auditory Nerve deſcending towards the root of the Tongue, is diſtributed to its Muſcles, and to thoſe of the Bone <hi>Hyoides,</hi> and ſo actuates ſome of the Organs for the framing the Voice. For this reaſon in ſome meaſure it comes to paſs, that living Creatures being aſtoniſhed at an unaccuſtomed or horrid ſound, preſently putting forth an uncertain voice, cry out and make a noiſe. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of theſe kind of Nerves in man ſerves for another more noted uſe, to wit, that the voice might fitly anſwer to the hearing, and that this might be ſet as the Echo of the ſound admitted by this: ſo indeed, as on the other ſide, there be two Nerves of the ſame pair, the ſound is received by the hearing through one, which is rendred again by the voice through the other. The common and extrinſick Echo conſiſts in this, that a certain undulation or waving of the Air ſhaken or moved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up, and tending towards or about, when by reaſon of ſome ſtop or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, it cannot go any further directly, being preſently repercuſſed or ſtruck back or reflected at certain angles, it is terminated contrary to the former bound. In like manner, in the hearing, the impreſſion of the ſound, or the Species admitted to the Ears by the hearing faculty of the Proceſſes of the ſame or neighbouring Nerve, and being carried inwardly towards the Cerebel and common Senſory, and from thence again reflected on the vocal proceſs, it is carried out by the Mouth. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe there is ſome difference, to wit, foraſmuch as the outward Echo renders back the ſound immediately; but the ſound of the Hearing is not neceſſarily carried forth at the mouth preſently, but that this leaves an Idea in the Head, according to which afterwards, as occaſion ſerves, the voice is formed, which bears the type and image of that, though ſome time before admitted.</p>
                     <p>But here (if I may digreſs a little) we ſhould inquire in what part of the Head the Ideas of ſounds are left: whether only in the Brain, which is the Cheſt of Memory acquired as it were artificial; or whether not alſo in the Cerebel, which is the place of natural memory? Truly we ſuppoſe, that ſounds belong to both theſe, as it were to diſtinct Store-houſes. Every audible impulſe being ſtruck againſt the Ear, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carried by the paſſage of the auditory Proceſs to the annulary Protuberance; but from thence it is carried, as other ſenſible Species, to the chamfered bodies or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſory; (which way it paſſes thither, ſhall be ſhewed afterwards) this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tending from thence farther, and being alſo delivered to the Brain, ſtirs up the Imagination, and ſo leaves in its Cortex an image or private mark of it ſelf for the Memory. Further alſo, as the auditory Proceſs depends on the Cerebel, and receives from it the proviſion of the animal Spirits: ſo it is moſt likely, that by the receſs of the ſame Spirits the Ideas of the Sounds are conveyed alſo to the Cerebel; which forming there footſteps or tracts, impreſs a remembrance of themſelves, from whence when afterwards the Species there laid up are drawn forth by the help of the vocal proceſs, voices, like the ſounds before admitted, and breaking forth in a certain ordained ſeries, come to be made.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is uſual, that muſick or melody is ſoon learnt by ſome men, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107014:87"/>they bring forth with exact Symphony, without any meditation or labour of the Brain; to wit, from the diſtinct accents of the heard harmony, the Spirits moving within the Cerebel are diſpoſed into peculiar Schemes; according to which, when they flow on both ſides into the vocal proceſs of the auditory Nerve, they render as it were with a certain ſpontaneous voice, and like a Mathine or Clock with the ſucceſſion of Species, the meaſures or Tunes of the Inſtrument which they had drunk in at the ears. Without doubt hence the reaſon may be ſought, why ſome men learn Muſick without any trouble, and others hardly or not at all. For it is obſerved, that ſome Children, before they can ſpeak diſtinctly, quickly ſing, and remember certain Tunes; whilſt others, though very ingenious men and of excellent memory, are very Fools at Muſick, and become uncapable, as an Aſs for the Harp; wherefore that faculty. In the mean time, 'tis to be confeſſed, thatin theſe the Organs of the Voice are not defective; but all the fault, though wrongfully, is caſt on the hearing.</p>
                     <p>But in truth the genuine cauſe of this defect ſeems to conſiſt in this, that when in all, the audible Species go to the Cerebel ſooner and more immediately than the Brain; yet in ſome the Cerebel being harder, and not eaſily yielding to the received impreſſions, thoſe Species, becauſe they could impreſs nothing of themſelves in their paſſing to the Cerebel, being-carried towards the common Senſory, leave their Types or Ideas chiefly and almoſt wholly in the Brain: which part being ſtill buſied with diſturbed motions, is leſs apt to keep diſtinctly the compoſures of Harmony. But in the mean time, in others the Species of audible things, beſides that they are carried to the common Senſory and to the Brain, do alſo affect the Cerebel, eſpecially if they are harmonically figured (foraſmuch as in them there is a ſoſter capacity of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) with a peculiar order and Scheme of the animal Spirits: where, as the Species of the Harmony being diſpoſed in convenient little places and cells are kept, afterwards they flow out from thence, almoſt unthought of, without any endeavour or labour of remembrance, but in a diſtinct ſeries, and as it were in compoſed modes and figures, and ſo by blowing up the vocal proceſſes, they conſtitute ſweet Tunes and vocal Muſick.</p>
                     <p>If that the divers ways of paſſage are inquired into, to wit, whereby the audible Species, being carried into the annular Protuberance, do get-both to the Brain and Cerebel; I ſay it is not improbable, but out of that Protuberance both a paſſage lyes open into the underlying tract of the oblong Marrow, and as it were the high road; as alſo another paſſage is opened into the Cerebel through the medullar proceſſes of the ſame Ring. But leſt there ſhould perchance be a conſuſion of the animal Spirits and the ſenſible Species, (which indeed can hardly be avoided) if the way made for their paſſage ſhould Iye open into various paſſages and manifold apertures; therefore concerning this it may well be ſuppoſed, that the Ideas of the Sounds paſs through the Cerebel, when they are carried to the common Senſory; which region being firſt paſt, they are at length brought by a by-path, <hi>viz.</hi> through the orbicular Prominences to the chamfered Bodies: which perhaps is partly the reaſon, that in the Hearing the perception of the ſenſe ſucceeds ſo late, and the impulſe of the object, in reſpect of ſight, follows ſo ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt therefore the audible Species paſſes through the Cerebel, in ſome men, it leaves in this region (for that it is of a ſoft temper, and fit for the receiving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) tracts and marks of it ſelf, and ſo they obtain muſical ears. But in others who have a harder frame of the Cerebel, they produce no tracts of the ſame Sounds, and therefore ſuch are wholly deſtitute of the faculty of Muſick.</p>
                     <p>As therefore we ſuppoſe the audible Species to paſs through the Cerebel after this manner, a reaſon may be given from hence, wherefore Muſick does not only affect the Phantaſie with a certain delight, but beſides chears a ſad and ſorrowful Heart; yea, allays all turbulent Paſſions excited in the Breaſt from an immoderate heat and fluctuation of the blood. For ſince the animal Spirits, ſerving for the motion of the <hi>Pracordia,</hi> are derived from the Cerebel; as the perturbations conceived in the Brain, the influence being tranſmitted hither by moving theſe Spirits in the Fountain it ſelf, transfer the force of their Affections on the Breaſt; ſo the Melody introduced to the Ears, and diffuſed through this Province, does as it were inchant with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle breath the Spirits there inhabiting, and compoſes them, called off from their fury, to numbers and meaſures of dancing, and ſo appeaſes all tumults and inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein excited.</p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:107014:88"/>
                     <p>From theſe may in ſome meaſure be known the reaſon of the difference, why the hearing Nerves are after a different manner in man and in four-footed beaſts: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe there is little need that the audible Species ſhould paſs through the Cerebel, either for the reciprocations of the ſound heard, by the voice, or for the impreſſing there the Tunes of the Harmony (for neither is Muſick required, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Poets feign, to the taming the Affections which move the breaſts of beaſts) therefore in theſe (I mean in four-footed beaſts) the annular Protuberance diſpenſing the animal Spirits to the auditory Nerves, and receiving from them the ſenſible Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, requires not ſo ſtrict an affinity with the Cerebel: yea, whenas it may ſuffice, that thoſe Nerves ariſe from the oblong Marrow, yet the annular Protuberance, as it were a common Porch, ought to be prefixed to them; to wit, in which both the Spirits going out from either ſide, and the ſenſible Species to be carried to either, ought firſt to be mixed and united together, leſt otherwiſe every ſound ſhould become double.</p>
                     <p>Among the Nerves which are ſeen to belong to the Cerebel, and to perſorm its offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, laſtly follow the eighth or wandring pair, which indeed hath its riſe out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trunk of the oblong Marrow, near the place where the laſt proceſs of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel is terminated, and over againſt where the pyramidal bodies, being produced from the annular Protuberance, end: ſo that we think theſe Nerves alſo, by that proceſs coming between on either ſide, and alſo perhaps in ſome meaſure through the paſſage of the pyramidal bodies, do derive all manner of influence of the animal Spirit from the Cerebel.</p>
                     <p>The beginning of theſe conſiſts of very many fibres and filaments or little threads preſently diſtinct one from another; to which belongs, from the very beginning of every Nerve, a noted Trunk ariſing out of the ſpinal Marrow. The deſcription of the wandring pair of Nerves, and its protenſion into the <hi>Pracordia</hi> and ſome <hi>Viſcera,</hi> are added hereafter. For the preſent it ſhall ſuffice, that we take notice, that for as much as this Nerve is beſtowed chiefly on the <hi>Pracordia,</hi> the acts whereof are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, and are performed without our care or knowledge in ſleep as well as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and for that the ſame Nerve ſeems to receive the forces of the Spirits wholly from the nearer fountain of the Cerebel; from hence it may certainly be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the government or oeconomy of the Cerebel regards only the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Function.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Nerves, which being ſubjected to the Government and Laws of the Cerebel, ſeem to obey and ſerve under it: among which moreover ought to be placed the ſourth pair, or the pathetick Nerves of the Eyes, to wit, which ariſing out of the firſt proceſſes of the Cerebel, come between that and the orbicular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; of the uſe of which we have ſpoken already. Further, we ſhall here take notice, that ſome other Nerves to be deſcribed below, for that they communicate with the aforeſaid Nerves near their originals, cauſe alſo ſome involuntary acts to be performed; of which ſort are firſt the ninth pair, the ſpinal Nerve acceſſory to the wandring pair, alſo the Nerve of the Diaphragma, and ſome others, as we ſhall ſhew more at large in the particular Hiſtory of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>We may alſo obſerve, concerning the Nerves but now deſcribed, which owe their ſtock to the Cerebel, and ſeem to be deſigned for the offices of the involuntary Function, that ſometimes ſome of them, though of another Dominion, are compelled to obey the beck and government of the Brain: for we are wont to draw the parts of the Face, uſually moved pathetically and unthought of, and alſo at our pleaſure, into theſe or thoſe Configurations or poſtures: we are able alſo in a meaſure to alter the motions and actions of the <hi>Pracordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> at the will or command of the Appetite. The reaſon of theſe is, partly becauſe the Nerves of either Government communicate variouſly among themſelves with ſhoots ſent forth one to another, ſo that oftentimes the offices of the one are drawn into the parts of the other. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have mentioned before, that the ſenſible impreſſion being inflicted on the parts of the involuntary Function, foraſmuch as it is vehement, like a ſtrong waving of water, paſſing through the Cerebel, affects the Brain it ſelf. In like manner it may be thought concerning the motion which belongs to thoſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> that made after the ordinary manner, that it is performed by the command of the Cerebel. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome more ſevere Edicts of the Brain, by the by-paſſage of the Prominen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, belong alſo to the Cerebel, and determine the Offices of the Inhabitants of it to be performed at the beck of the Appetite. As every one ſees that violent Paſſions
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107014:88"/>(whether the will be privy or not) eaſily do this; why therefore may not the will it ſelf alſo, as occaſion requires, exerciſe the ſame dominion? But in the mean time, this derogates nothing from the priviledges of the Cerebel, that it may not be called a free and municipal City, and ſo Miſtreſs of the involuntary Function; for that in ſome few it is after the manner of the Brain: becauſe the Brain it ſelf in many things is compelled to ſerve the Cerebel and its Government, as we have already ſhewn, and is neceſſarily bound to it. For the Brain owes much to the Cerebel, foraſmuch as it receives from the vital Function (which is of its Province) the proviſion of the blood, and by conſequence the Tribute of the Spirits produced of it: ſo indeed that both theſe parts, though Principals, perform mutual offices, and as it were in a circle, require and accompliſh ſervices one for another.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEſides the aforeſaid Nerves, to wit, the fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth pair which are imployed for the performing the tacit Edicts of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel for every involuntary Function, and thoſe equal in number to the reſt ſubject to the Brain, that cauſe the Cerebel to have an Empire divided with it; there are alſo ſome Proceſſes and Protuberances, which being placed before and behind the Cerebel, are its Appendixes, that are taken into part of the ſame Office and Miniſtry. The deſcription and uſe of theſe, are already particularly delivered. But for that (as a while ſince we intimated) there happens a certain reſpect or habit between the orbicular Prominences, which is the anterior Appendix of the Cerebel, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nular Protuberance, which is the other poſterior Appendix of the ſame, and that one part is proportionate to the magnitude of the other; ſo as when the natiform Prominences are greater or greateſt, the annular Protuberance is always ſmaller or ſmalleſt; and on the contrary, they who have this latter in a very great bulk, in them the other is leſſer; and ſo for that either part ſeems to be a peculiar Repoſitory of the Spirits, which belong to the oeconomy of the Cerebel, when a greater proviſion of them is laid up in one Store-houſe, therefore there reſides a leſſer in the other; when I ſay there is this kind of conſtant relation found between theſe parts, it yet remains for us to find out for what end this is ſo conſtituted.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that the animal Spirits are diſpoſed within the ſeveral parts of the Head in diſtinct Schemes of Rays, through which are variouſly tranſmitted, as through Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective glaſſes, the impreſſions of ſenſible things and the inſtincts of motions to be performed; it eaſily occurs, that there are commerces had this way and that way in the natiform Prominences between the Brain and Cerebel; and that the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the annular Protuberance are <hi>Internuncii</hi> or Meſſengers going between, which transfer the mutual reſpects of the <hi>Pracordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as alſo of the parts that are wont to be pathetically moved. But if it be inquired into, what kind of commerces and reſpects thoſe are which the Brain carries to the Cerebel, and on the contrary, and that either have to the Organs of the vital and merely natural Function, we ſhall in ſo difficult and very intricate a matter propoſe our Opinion, though with an heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and doubtful mind.</p>
                     <p>We have before intimated, that the orbicular Prominences did deliver to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel the forces of the Paſſions to be carried from the Brain to the <hi>Pracordia,</hi> and did receive from it, and communicate to the Brain the neceſſities of the natural Inſtincts delivered from the <hi>Pracordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> to the Cerebel. To theſe moreover we add, that the annular Protuberance ſerves wholly for the ſame offices, though after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; to wit, this receives the forces of the Paſſions, as it were at a ſecond hand, from the Deputiſhip of the Cerebel, and transfers them then immediately to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107014:89"/>the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> and this ſeems to be the chiefeſt office of this part. Further, the ſame Ring receives immediately the natural Inſtincts from the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the middle and loweſt Belly, and impreſſes them on the Cerebel to be conveyed further to the Brain; which kind of uſe it exhibits ſecondarily by affording only a way of paſſage: For indeed ſuch Inſtincts having paſt through the Cerebel, we ſuppoſe to be formed and perfected within the orbicular Prominences, from whence being tranſmitted into the Brain, they draw forth requiſite actions without the previous knowledge of it, or intention of doing.</p>
                     <p>Hence it may be ſuppoſed, that the annular Protuberance contains chiefly the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits which perform the inteſtine commotions of the Affections. In every vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion of the Soul, preſently the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are greatly troubled, to wit, the ſame being variouſly drawn together or ſpread abroad, compel the blood into divers fluctuations; but indeed a great company of the Spirits, ſomewhere got together and ready for Excurſions in a ſet Battel, do perform theſe diſorders and irregular motions of the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> and for that the Spirits can be diſpoſed for this in no other part than here, before the beginnings of the Nerves, conſtituted for theſe offices; therefore this Protuberance in a man, by reaſon of the ragings of the Paſſions to be performed by a certain force and incitation, is far greater than in any other Animal. For as he is wont to be ſuddenly and vehemently diſturbed, therefore the Promptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Store-houſe is required to be more large, in which a greater plenty of Spirits may be kept, to be beſtowed on ſuch inordinations of the Affections. Next to a man this part is greateſt in a Dog, Cat, and Fox; in a Calf, Sheep, Goat, Hare, and other milder Animals it is very ſmall.</p>
                     <p>But as the annular Protuberance ſeems to be the chief Organ or Cheſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, from whence the winds of the Paſſions, deſtinated for the exciting the <hi>Pracordia,</hi> are conveyed into the breaſt; ſo we ſuppoſe the orbicular Prominences to be a means of paſſage, and the very inſtruments whereby the inſtincts and neceſſities of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> are communicated from the Cerebel to the Brain. Yea, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits dwelling in this, as a retiring place, do not only tranſmit theſe kind of Ideas or formal Reaſons of the Inſtincts, but in ſome meaſure form and prepare them for the Brain. For when as ſome brute Animals, whoſe Brain is not imbued with a previous knowledge or practical habits, chuſe and bring forth ſome ſpontaneous actions as it were with judgment and deliberation, certainly we may believe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of theſe kind of acts are ſuggeſted from ſome other place than the Brain, to wit, from the aforeſaid Prominences. Wherefore 'tis to be obſerved, that in ſome Brutes endued with an indocil or dull Brain, the Buttock-like Prominences are greateſt, as may be ſeen in a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many others; which Animals, as ſoon as they are brought to light, preſently ſeek for their food, and what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous for them they readily know. But in a Man, a Dog, Fox, and the like, who are more apt to learn and acquire habits, theſe Prominences are very ſmall; and theſe Animals being newly born, are furniſhed only with a rude and imperfect ſenſe; beſides, they are found wholly unapt to ſeek out their food. Upon this Obſervation (which holds good in moſt Animals which I have yet happened to diſſect) as upon a Baſis or foundation I dare build this kind of abſtruſe Hypotheſis concerning the natural Inſtincts and Affections of the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> For as the living Creatures which are more ſtrong in inſtinct, as Sheep, Hogs, Oxen, Goats, and other ſlow and gentler beaſts, that are not obnoxious to Paſſions, are alſo leſs docile or apt to learn; and on the contrary, they in whom the Affections are wont to predominate, and who are furniſhed with a certain wit, (as beſides Man, are Dogs, Foxes, and ſome other hotter Animals) are leſs powerful in Inſtinct: and as I have obſerved in the frequent Diſſection of all ſorts of Heads, that in thoſe kind of living Creatures, who live rather by Wit than Inſtinct, the annular Protuberance, placed below the Cerebel, was notedly great, and the orbicular Prominences only very ſmall; but in other living Creatures, where the Inſtinct exceeded the wit, and who were leſs prone to ſtrong Affections, the orbicular Prominences were very great, and on the contrary, the ringy Protuberance exceeding ſmall: From hence I was forced to think, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicular or natiform Prominences, where they are great, are inſtead of another or ſupplementory Brain, and the chief Organs of the natural Inſtincts; yet ſo, as theſe parts alſo ſerve for a way or means of paſſage for the transferring the Paſſions from the Brain towards the Cerebel and <hi>Praecordia;</hi> and that (as we have already hinted) the greater exiſtency of the annular Protuberance is to contain plenty of Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107014:89"/>for the winds of the Paſſions; yet in the mean time, by a further tending forwards or declination of the Spirits inhabiting this, the Species of the natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, being ſent from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> paſs through. But however the buſineſs is, becauſe nothing can be certainly affirmed, or by demonſtration, if this our Opinion pleaſe not others, at leaſt it may be pardoned.</p>
                     <p>There remains not much more to be ſpoken concerning the Offices and Uſes of the Cerebel and its Appendix. Concerning its ſubſtance, there is ſomething more worthy taking notice of, to wit, that it very much differs in this reſpect from the ſtructure of the Brain alſo, for that its cortical little circles are not founded in the ſtretched out Marrow, as the convolutions of the Brain; but being deeply cut in, are diſcontinued in their whole tract: ſo that the whole Syſtem of the Cerebel is as it were a cluſter of Grapes compacted cloſely together; in which, although the Berries be contiguous, yet they remain diſtinct one from another, and bring forth fiſſures through the whole thickneſs of the maſs. Yea the outward ſuperficies of the Cerebel conſiſts as it were of very many Tubercles or little Tad-ſtoles or Puffs which grow together on little ſtalks; and thoſe ſtalks paſs into greater branches, and they at length being bipartite or twofold, go together into two larger Marrows near the bottom of the Cerebel, in either of which are three diſtinct medullary Proceſſes: of which threefold proceſſes on either ſide we have already ſpoken. But of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of the Cerebel in general, we ſhall yet further advertiſe you, that as very much of its ſubſtance is cortical, it begets animal Spirits in great plenty, to which in the circulating there is not granted, as in the Brain, an equally great ſpace; for that there ſeems not to be much need of it in the animal Government. For the Spirits ſo produced in the Cerebel plentifully by a perpetual emanation, ought to flow outwardly for the offices of the natural and vital Function: but more inwardly for the impulſes variouſly ſent into them, they admit certain undulations or wavings, by which ſome occaſional acts of the involuntary Function are brought forth, as is ſhewn before.</p>
                     <p>But as it is manifeſt enough, that the animal Spirits are generated within the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical little circles of the Cerebel, it doth not ſeem needful that we ſhould ordain their Work-houſe in the Ventricle ſubject to its frame. For that Cavity (as we have already ſhewn) is only an empty ſpace, which lying under its double little foot and medullar Trunk, comes between it and the overlying bunching out of the Cerebel. But indeed there belongs to this beſides a certain uſe, to wit, that the ſerous warry heap laid aſide out of the Glandula's and infoldings of the Veſſels, as alſo from the ſubſtance of the Cerebel, being made over-moiſt, diſtilling down, might ſlide into this Ciſtern. From whence, leſt it ſhould flow down upon the beginnings of the Nerves, by a reſtraining Membrane it is compelled into the hole of the ſtrait Den lying under the orbicular Prominences; and from thence is received from the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aperture of the Tunnel, and carried out.</p>
                     <p>Below the Cerebel, the oblong Marrow going forward with the reſt of its tract even to the hole of the hinder part of the Head, ends at length in the ſpinal Marrow: but in its Trunk, as yet contained within the Skull, beſides the Nerves and Proceſſes but now recited, the beginnings of the ninth and tenth pair of Nerves are alſo radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Of which there will be hereafter a proper place to ſpeak, when we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the whole Neurology or the Doctrine of the Nerves. In the mean time, we ſhall take notice of the beginning of the ninth pair, which is peculiar in Man, and different from what is found in Brutes: To wit, in Man below the origine of the eighth pair, a certain Protuberance grows to either ſide of the oblong Marrow. Out of that four or five diſtinct Fibres do come forth; one or two of which binds about the Vertebral Artery paſſing through it, but all grow together into the ſame Trunk, which is the Nerve of the aforeſaid pair. This Protuberance, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being pulled away, may be eaſily ſeen, and ſeems to be the Repoſitory or Store-houſe of the Spirits deſtinated to this Nerve.</p>
                     <p>For as this Nerve is beſtowed on the Tongue and its Muſcles, and ſo conduces chiefly to the performing of ſpeech in Man, who hath a greater and more frequent uſe and exerciſe of the voice, there ſeems to be need of a great proviſion of Spirits, plenty of which ought always to be in a readineſs. But in Brutes, who have none, or a rarer neceſſity of the voice, ſuch a Protuberance is wanting, becauſe it is not required in them that the Spirits ſhould be gathered together by heaps, as it were in a certain Porch, before the Organs of the Voice, but that it may ſuffice for them to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107014:90"/>be called forth by degrees out of the common tract of the oblong Marrow. Further, whereas ſome fibres of this Nerve bind about either Vertebral Artery, unleſs I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that is ſo ordained for this end, leſt perhaps in ſpeaking, when at any time we are more vehemently moved, the blood being ſtirred up, might ruſh upon the Brain with a torrent. For this Nerve binding about the Vertebral Artery, as it were with a bridle, and ſo as a Moderator not only of the Tongue, but alſo of the Blood, reſtrains its more rapid influence. After the ſame manner, and for no other ends, do the recurrent Nerves, deſtinated to ſome part of the ſame office, variouſly bind about the Trunk of the great Artery, as ſhall be ſhewn afterwards.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as this inferior portion of the oblong Marrow is uncloathed from the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> the pyramidal bodies come in view otherwiſe lying hid. Theſe in all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, endued with the annular Protuberance, are conſtantly found; alſo as that Protuberance is bigger, ſo theſe bodies appear more noted: but indeed in a Man and a Dog they ſeem like two large Nerves, which being produced out of that Ring, end over againſt where the eighth pair ariſe in ſharp points. If the uſe of theſe be ſought into, it is moſt likely, that the animal Spirits ſuperabounding in the annular proviſion or ſtore, do flow out as it were by theſe Emiſſaries, which Spirits however run into the beginnings of the eighth pair placed near, and ſo are beſtowed by their proper means on the offices of the involuntary Function.</p>
                     <p>Although the oblong Marrow retains not its name beyond the limits of the Skull; yet it is the ſame ſubſtance, which from thence being continued further into the cavity and utmoſt receſſes of the whole Spine or Back-bone, is called the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but it is brought forth for this, that the Nerves to be diſtributed into the Limbs and Members more remote from the Head, might more commodiouſly ariſe out of the ſame medullar ſubſtance ſtretched out into the neighbourhood of every part. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all this whole medullar Trunk, which is continued from the bottom of the Brain even to the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> ſeems like the Pneumatick Cheſt, or Bellows of a pair of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, which includes the blaſt or breath deſtinated to every Pipe; for in like manner the animal Spirits are contained in this marrowy tract, which blow up and actuate all the Nerves hanging thereto, as occaſion ſerves.</p>
                     <p>If you behold the origine of the whole, it ſeems that the whole frame both of this oblong Marrow and the ſpinal, is of a medullar or marrowy ſubſtance, every where growing diſperſedly through the Brain and Cerebel, and then being gathered more round together in the middle of either, becomes as one heap. For the Marrows beſmearing all their folds and turnings about, are as ſo many little rivers, which ſpringing from thence, begin to be congregated in the middle, and to be poured out in one great one; but being from thence united, they make the oblong Marrow, as it were the chanel of the Sea, big enough for the motion or ebbing and flowing and reciprocation of the animal Spirits: which belly or chanel, however ſtretching it ſelf further beyond the Skull, is increaſed into the ſpinal Marrow, as it were the boſom or proceſs of the former.</p>
                     <p>But as the medullar tracts, beſmearing the folds and convolutions of the Brain and Cerebel, unfold themſelves into their middle Marrows and medullar Trunk, and ſo the Spirits ſpringing diſperſedly from their firſt fountains, congregate as it were into a certain diffuſed Sea; ſo from this Sea, cauſing an ebbing and flowing, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual or very frequent influence of the animal Spirit, the ſame Spirits flow out into the depending chanels of the nervous Syſtem.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this part of this Marrow, which being included in the long boſom or chanel of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or Back-bone, and according to all their joyntings, being mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as it were knotty proceſſes, is called the Spinal, there occur not many things worthy conſideration, beſides what are commonly known. The figure, ſituation, as alſo the body of this, in its whole tract, are known generally to be cloven in two, not only by Anatomiſts, but by every Butcher. The ramifications or branchings of the Nerves, proceeding from the ſpinal Marrow, are delivered hereafter. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its conformation ſomething peculiar occurs. For as the ſpinal Marrow is as it were the common paſſage or chanel of the Spirits flowing out of the Head into the Nerves, it may be obſerved, that this chanel, not after the uſual manner of other paſſages, where many rivers flow in, doth ſwell up more; but on the contrary, in what place it hath more and greater Emiſſaries, its magnitude is increaſed; for in thoſe parts of the ſpinal Marrow, out of which the brachial and crural Nerves ariſe, (or thoſe Nerves belonging to the Arms and Legs, whoſe beginnings are more and larger)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107014:90"/>its Trunk becomes much thicker than in the reſt of the frame or ſubſtance. The reaſon of this is, becauſe within the medullar tracts the animal Spirits run not, nor paſs through with ſo ſwift a paſſage, but for the moſt part flowing leiſurely from their Fountains, when they have filled the whole ſpace, they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay therein; and as many Spirits, upon occaſion offered, are wont to be beſtowed on every work, thoſe remaining there in readineſs frame certain convenient Promptuaries where they may divert themſelves. Wherefore we ordinarily obſerve, not only of this Marrow, but of the Nerves themſelves, that as often as a ſmall branch is diſtributed into many ſhoots or ſuckers to be ſent forth here and there, always in the very knot of the diviſion there grows a far greater fold than in the reſt of the Trunk of the Nerve; ſo that 'tis a wonder from whence the Nerve ſhould acquire ſo in the middle of its paſſage a new ſubſtance and more ample bulk. But of theſe things and others belonging to the Doctrine of the Nerves, it behoves us to diſcourſe in the following Chapters.</p>

                           <hi>Of the Nervous Syſtem in general, where its parts (which are the Nerves and Fibres) being deſigned, a proſpect of the whole Animal Government is exhibited.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHenas hitherto having beheld the ſeveral Regions of the Brain it ſelf, the Cerebel, and medullar Appendix, and the proviſion and offices of them all, we have deſigned or drawn forth the uſes and employments alſo of the parts and proceſſes, and the ſanguiferous Veſſels belonging to every one of theſe; it is now time for me to ſtop and retire into the Port from this troubleſom and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Sea of Diſquiſition: But indeed, becauſe I find that I have not yet reached to the fartheſt ſhores and utmoſt parts; but that beyond this Sea, which we have ſailed through, as yet the nervous Syſtem, and very many Creeks or Boſoms, Meanders, and highly intricate Receſſes or private places in it remain to be viewed; therefore although we know it is difficult to proceed with full Sail, we have reſolved to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the task of the Doctrine of the Nerves; and the rather, becauſe without the perfect knowledge of the Nerves the Doctrine of the Brain and its Appendix would be left wholly lame and imperfect; for neither what hath already been delivered concerning them can be ſufficiently underſtood or illuſtrated, nor (which I chiefly deſire, and is the end of the former Diſquiſitions) without thoſe things before known can the Pathology of the Brain and nervous ſtock be rightly inſtituted. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are many things which might eaſily deter any one from ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: to wit, the hardneſs of the work, and full of hazard; which promiſes at firſt ſight more difficulty and thorny labour, than pleaſure or profit. Then ſome will object, that this Province is already ſo perfectly cultivated, and adorned by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Anatomiſts, that by a repetition of the ſame, I may ſeem to have medled with a thing done to my hand. But I may readily anſwer to theſe, firſt, That the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Nerves yields more pleaſant and profitable Speculations, than the Theory of any parts beſides in the animated Body: for from hence the true and genuine Reaſons are drawn of very many Actions and Paſſions that are wont to happen in our Body, which otherwiſe ſeem moſt difficult and unexplicable; and no leſs from this Fountain the hidden Cauſes of Diſeaſes and their Symptoms, which commonly are aſcribed to the Incantations of Witches, may be found out and clearly laid open. But as to our Obſervations about the Nerves, from our following Diſcourſe it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that I have not trod the paths or footſteps of others, nor repeated what hath been before told.</p>
                     <p>Therefore that according to our determination we may enter upon the explanation of the nervous Syſtem, we ſhall comprehend under this name all parts, upon which gifted with the animal Spirit, Motion and Senſe neceſſarily and immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, to wit, for the performing either one only, or both together in the whole Body. But theſe kind of parts, in reſpect of the Head and marrowy Appendix, are like a branching ſtock or imps growing out of the trunk of a Tree: for ſuppoſing that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107014:91"/>the cortical ſubſtances of the Brain and Cerebel are in the place of roots, and that the ſubſtances every where medullar are taken for the ſtock or pith; the nervous ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or budding forth expanded into divarications of Nerves and Fibres, will appear like ſo many little branches, twigs, and leaves. Or if the Head containing in it ſelf the chief part and power of the ſenſitive Soul, be taken for the body of ſome Luminary, as of the Sun or a Star; the nervous Syſtem ſhall be that radiant or beamy concretion compaſſing it about. Becauſe the animal Spirits flowing from the Brain and Cerebel, with the medullar Appendix of either, as it were from a double Luminary, irradiate the nervous Syſtem, and ſo conſtitute its ſeveral parts, the Organs of Motion or Senſe, or of both together, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The parts of the nervous Syſtem, as a radiant or beamy texture, are either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, <hi>viz.</hi> the bodies themſelves of the Nerves, into which the animal Spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flow from the Head and its medullar Appendix; or ſecondarily, which are Fibres planted or interwoven in the Membranes, muſculous Fleſh, Tendons, and ſome of the Parenchyma, which alſo contain in themſelves animal Spirits; but they receive them not but mediately and ſecondarily derived from the Head through the bodies of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſhewed that the animal Spirits are procreated only in the Brain and Cerebel, from which they continually ſpringing forth, inſpire and fill full the medullar Trunk: (like the Cheſt of a muſical Organ, which receives the wind to be blown into all the Pipes) but thoſe Spirits being carried from thence into the Nerves, as into ſo many Pipes hanging to the ſame, blow them up and actuate them with a full influence; then what flow over or abound from the Nerves, enter the Fibres diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed every where in the Membranes, Muſcles, and other parts, and ſo impart to thoſe bodies, in which the nervous Fibres are interwoven, a motive and ſenſitive or feeling force. And theſe Spirits of every part are called Implanted, foraſmuch as they flow not within the Nerves, as the former, with a perpetual flood; but being ſomething more ſtable and conſtant, ſtay longer in the ſubject bodies; and only as occaſion ſerves, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the impreſſions inwardly received from the Nerves, or impreſſed outwardly by the objects, are ordained into divers ſtretchings or carryings out for the effecting of motion or ſenſe either of this or that manner or kind.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the animal Spirits flowing within the Nerves with a living Spring, like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from a perpetual Fountain, do not ſtagnate or ſtand ſtill; but ſliding forth with a continual courſe, are ever ſupplied and kept full with a new influence from the Fountain. In the mean time, the Spirits in the reſt of the nervous kind, eſpecially thoſe abounding in the Membranes and muſculous ſtock, are like Ponds and Lakes of Waters lately diffuſed from the chanels of Rivers, whoſe waters ſtanding ſtill are not much moved of their own accord; but being agitated by things caſt into them, or by the blaſts of winds, conceive divers ſorts of fluctuations.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe there is no light difference between the motions and conſiſtency of the Spirits and of Waters, perhaps it will better illuſtrate the matter, if the Spirits of either kind, to wit, the inflowing and implanted, are compared to the beaming forth of divers rays of light. And ſo when light is let into a dark chamber, and preſently inlightens the whole, we may conceive the particles of the light ſo ſwiftly diffuſed to be of a twofold kind; to wit, ſome are bodies ſent from the light it ſelf, which diffuſe themſelves every way into an Orb; and other luminous particles are as it were Etherial little bodies exiſting before in the pores of the Air, which being agitated by the former, and as it were inkindled, cauſe as it were a flamy, though moſt thin contexture, ſtretched out in the whole clearneſs. After the like manner, the animal Spirits flowing from the medullar ſubſtance into the Nerves, are as it were rays dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed from the light it ſelf, and the other Spirits every where abounding in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, are as ſo many lucid particles included and implanted in the Air, which are actuated by the former, and being ſtirred up by them into motion, perform the acts both of the ſenſitive and locomotive Faculty.</p>
                     <p>That it may the better appear by what means the animal Spirits do irradiate and ſwiftly paſs through the parts of the nervous Syſtem, both primary and ſecondary; ſo that light is ſcarcely carried ſwifter through a diaphanous Medium, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Spirits is made from one end of the nervous Syſtem to the other; it will be requiſite to inquire here a little concerning the Origine of the Nerves and nervous Fibres, alſo of their Fabrick and Conformation, to wit, what pores and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages either of theſe bodies have, and how diſpoſed for the paſſing through and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the animal Spirits.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107014:91"/>
                     <p>As to the Nerves, it is manifeſt from what hath been ſaid, that all of them are produced immediately out of the medullar Trunk or its proceſſes; ſo that as theſe parts are the common and broad roads which lead both from the Brain and from the Cerebel, all the Nerves are particular paths reaching out from them on every ſide into the ſeveral Regions of the animated Body. Wherefore the ſame Marrow, which is the original of every Nerve or Sinew, foraſmuch as it is drawn into a more thin thread, conſtitutes the matter of the ſame Nerve; which indeed, that it may be made more ſolid and compact, is cloathed with a peculiar production of the <hi>Pia Mater:</hi> for as from a Silver maſs gilt or inriched with Gold, all the threads produced from it are gilded; ſo the ſame Membrane, which covers the medullar Trunk, is produced together with all the Nerves coming out from the ſame, and cloathes them all. Further, very many Nerves ariſing together out of that marrowy beginning, go forth as it were by bands; which notwithſtanding, for the ſake of the better paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being preſently united and carried out of their bony Cloiſter, are included in a common Coat taken from the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> For we ſuppoſe (which alſo ſhall be more clearly ſhewed anon) that all the Nerves, deſtinated to any parts or every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member, do ariſe diſtinctly and apart, and ſo remain in their whole paſſage. But in that oftentimes a Nerve appearing as it were one Trunk, afterwards ſeems to go into many branches, it is becauſe thoſe branches being indeed ſingular, and divided in the whole paſſage, are collected as it were into one bundle; for ſometimes we have ſeparated thoſe Nerves, ſeeming to grow together as it were into one rope or cord of a Nerve, one from another, dividing them to their very original; for neither otherwiſe could the Inſtincts of the Motions to be performed be carried ſo reſpectively to theſe or thoſe parts, ſeparate one from another, to which the branches of the ſame Trunk belong.</p>
                     <p>The paſſages of the Nerves are not bored through as the Veins and Arteries; for the ſubſtance of thoſe are not only impervious to any Bodkin, but no cavity can be ſeen in them, no not by the help of Spectacles or a Microſcope. As to what belongs to the ſmelling little Pipes, they ſeem to be ſo made, not for the paſſage of the animal Spirits, but that ſome ſeroſities might ſlide down that way: but the Spirits themſelves are carried in the ſides, and not in the cavity of either Pipe; but the ſubſtance of the other Nerves appears plainly firm and compacted, that the ſubtil humor, which is the Vehicle of the Spirits, may paſs through their frames or ſubſtances, even as the ſpirits of Wine, the extended ſtrings of a Lute, only by creeping leiſurely through. Hence it may be argued, that becauſe the animal Spirits require no manifeſt cavity within the Nerves for their expanſion; neither is there need of the like for them within the ſubſtance of the Brain; but that the Ventricles, commonly ſo called, ought to be deputed to ſome other office than this.</p>
                     <p>But the Nerves are white, ſmooth, and round bodies: within the Skull and nigh their beginnings, being as it were only covered with the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> they are ſoft and eaſily broken; without this, for that many of them are for the moſt part gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and alſo cloathed with the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> they become ſomewhat hard and more tenacious. The Nerves themſelves (as may be diſcovered by the help of a Microcoſm or Perſpective-glaſs) are furniſhed throughout with pores and paſſages, as it were ſo many little holes in a Honey-comb, thickly ſet, made hollow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous one by another; ſo the Tube-like ſubſtance of them, like an <hi>Indian</hi> Cane, is every where porous and pervious. Within theſe little ſpaces the animal Spirits or very ſubtil little Bodies, and of their own nature ever in a readineſs for motion, do gently flow; to which is joyned, both for a Vehicle, as alſo for a Bridle or ſtay, a watry Latex, and that it ſelf of very ſubtil parts, This Humor diffuſes with its flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity the Spirits through the whole nervous Syſtem; alſo by its viſcoſity retains them, that they be not wholly diſſipated, but as it were in a certain <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> and continued Series; for it ſeems, that without ſuch an Humor the Spirits could not conſiſt within the nervous ſtock, but they would vaniſh away into Air. Further, the ſame Humor is no leſs required for the paſſing through of the ſenſible Species: becauſe the animal Spirits, we ſuppoſe, like the rays of Light, to be diffuſed through the whole nervous Syſtem; and thoſe rays, unleſs the humid particles of the Air be mingled with them, do not eaſily tranſmit the forms or images of things; as is obvious in an Optick Scene, which is hid or ſhadowed by the clear beams or brightneſs of the Sun. And in like manner, from the defect or depravation of the nervous Juyce, we can readily ſhew, that the inordinations of the animal Spirits, and oftentimes moſt horrid diſtempers of the Brain and the nervous ſtock do ariſe.</p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:107014:92"/>
                     <p>This nervous Juyce being derived from the Brain and Cerebel into the medullar Appendix, is carried from thence by a gentle ſliding down through the Nerves even into the whole nervous ſtock, and waters its whole Syſtem. Upon the equal ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this depends the expanſion of the animal Spirits through the whole; and the ſubſtance of theſe, yea the Hypoſtaſis of the ſenſitive Soul it ſelf is founded on the diffuſion of the ſame humor. The animal Spirits being left to themſelves, follow the motion of this Juyce, and flowing together with it in the ſame courſe, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly or quietly expatiated; but in the mean time, as occaſion is offered, the ſame Spirits, as a breath moving upon thoſe waters, conceive other ſpreadings abroad, and thoſe more rapid. For as in a River, from winds or any thing caſt in, divers undulations or wavings are ſtirred up; ſo the animal Spirits being raiſed up by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the performing the offices of ſenſe and motion, do tend this way or that way to and fro within the nervous ſtock, and are agitated hither and thither by other means.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the parts of the nervous Syſtem, beſides the Nerves themſelves, Fibres alſo being diſperſedly interwoven in the Membranes, the muſculous Fleſh, the Parenchyma, and other parts, and united in the Tendons, are the Organs of ſenſe and motion. Yea, the acts of their faculties are principally and more immediately executed by the Fibres than the Nerves; for they, by drawing together the Muſcle and other motive parts, cauſe the motion it ſelf; but the Nerves only carry from the Head the inſtinct for the performing of that motion. In like manner, in Senſation the Fibres receive firſt of all and immediately the impreſſions of ſenſible things, and expreſs the ſame (as muſical ſtrings do the ſtrikings of a quill or fingers) by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal modification of the Particles, and repreſent the various approaches of the object by the like motion of the Fibrils, as by a moveable and fluid Character, whoſe Idea the Nerves transfer only to the Head.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the nervous Fibres it behoves us to inquire from whence they have their riſe? For it appears plainly, that they ariſe not immediately from the Head or its medullar Appendix; nor is it leſs improbable, that they are produced (as 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid) from the Nerves: becauſe what is aſſerted, that the Fibres are productions of the Nerves, and little bits or pieces of them torn off, as it were into hairy branches, ſeems unlikely; for that the Fibres in ſome parts, being placed nigh, exceed in their bulk the magnitude of the Nerve that is brought to that part, at leaſt an hundred-fold: which thing appears clearly from the Tendon of every Muſcle, which being made up of united Fibres, is obſerved to be far greater than the Nerve inſerted to it. And indeed for almoſt the like reaſon we are induced to think the nervous Humor it ſelf alſo, whereby the Membranes and muſculous Fibres are wont to be watered, to be derived unto them not by the only means and paſſage of the Nerves; becauſe it is heaped up much more plentifully and in more abundance than can be carried thither through thoſe narrow paſſages, as appears clearly in Ulcers of the Kings Evil, or in Impoſtumes or Wounds of the Tendons and nervous parts, in which a glutinous Humor drops forth in ſo great abundance, that all the Nerves of the whole Body could ſcarce be able to ſupply it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore concerning theſe, it ſeems that we may affirm, that the Fibres are not continued portions of the Nerves broken off into little hairy ſtrings or Capillaments; and that all the Fibres originally proceed not from the Nerves, becauſe ſome of them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe interwoven to the Heart and its Veſſels are of equal birth with the Nerves themſelves, and coexiſt with them together from the beginning. However moſt Fibres, as to their production, depend upon the Nerves; and all, which way ſoever brought forth, receive conſtantly from the Nerves the forces and ſupplements of the animal Spirits, and alſo the Inſtincts of the Motions to be performed by them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to recount the births or kinds of Fibres; they are firſt either ſpermatick and firſt begotten, the rudiments or firſt beginnings of which being of the like anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as the Heart and Brain, placed in the Conception, afterwards leiſurely increaſe; to wit, ſuch are, as hath been ſaid, thoſe in the Heart it ſelf in its depending Veſſels, the Membranes and ſome other parts, which form the firſt ſtuff or threads of the Embryo: or ſecondly, other Fibres are produced ſecondarily, and by a ſecond birth; of which ſort chiefly are ſuch which are interwoven into the parts taken for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the animal Fabrick, and eſpecially thoſe termed Sanguineous, which we think to be begotten after this manner.</p>
                     <p>The Heart and Brain, with the Arteries and Nerves hanging to them, are primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious parts, and highly original; but theſe, for the ſecond birth of others, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107014:92"/>for the nutrition and increaſe of all the ſenſitive parts, diſtribute a twofold humor: <hi>viz.</hi> one ſpirituous and endued with very active Particles which perpetually flow, though but in a very ſmall quantity, through the paſſages of the Nerves from the Brain and Cerebel; and the other ſlow and ſofter, which being every where laid aſide through the Arteries from the bloody maſs, is rendred more plentifully. This latter being of it ſelf dull and thicker by much, is actuated by the former, and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued by it, as by a certain Ferment, acquires ſtrength and power of growth or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation. But indeed the nervous Juyce, foraſmuch as it diffuſes with it ſelf the animal Spirits, imparts to every part, beſides the faculties of Motion and Senſe, the determinations alſo of form and figure. Further, whilſt that, being joyned to the other arterious humor, is diſpoſed into the ſubſtance and matter of the member or part to be nouriſhed, it forms ſome tracts as it were, to wit, the Fibres themſelves, in which the animal Spirits, coming together with them, reſide and are expatiated. Theſe twofold or twin humors, coupling together in every ſenſitive part, conſtitute a liquor truly nutritious, to wit, which is both ſpirituous and nouriſhable. And in truth, both theſe Juyces, <hi>viz.</hi> the nervous and arterious, being married together, are as it were the male and female ſeed, which being mingled in a fruitful womb, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the plaſtick Humor, by whoſe virtue the living creature is formed and increaſes. Hence may be obſerved, as the particles of the ſpirituous liquor, or of the other more watry juyce (<hi>viz.</hi> this latter being ſupplied from the Arteries, or that from the Nerves) are ſtrong or excel, as to their properties or powers, all living creatures become more or leſs nimble, active, and ready to any motion and labour. Beſides, from the default or depravation of the one and the other humor excelling, the ſorts or kinds of this or that diſeaſe are excited; concerning which, and alſo what belongs to the explication of the nutritious Humor, we may perhaps have ſome other time occaſion to diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>The animal Spirits which enter and fill the ordained ſeries of the Fibres as ſo many little places, flow thither by the paſſages of the Nerves; notwithſtanding the Spirits which are ſeated in the Fibres, interwoven with the muſculous ſtock, receive nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, yea and as it were auxiliary forces, from the arterious blood there plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flowing: whereby indeed both the Spirits themſelves acquire for the performing of Motions a greater force and as it were elaſtick; ſo that their force being ſtirred up by a ſtrong endeavour, it ſeems like the exploſion of Gun-powder; and alſo the ſame Spirits being continually conſumed within the Muſcles more profuſely than is wont to be in the Membranes and other parts, are in ſome meaſure made up or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired from the bloody ſuſtenance: becauſe whenas the arterious Juyce joyns more plentifully with the nervous flowing within the ſanguine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s parts, it may be well thought, that it alſo lays upon the Spirits brought thither with it, as it were ſome nitroſulphureous particles, and intimately fixes them on them; and ſo, by reaſon of this Copula, highly flatuous and apt to be rarified, the Spirits themſelves become there more active, ſo that in every motive endeavour, whereby the Muſcle is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly intumified, they, as if inkindled, are exploded. Moreover, a ſudden refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the conſumed or waſted Spirits, after great exerciſe or labour, is for this reaſon alſo performed by the blood; for that the ſpirituous particles being left and forſaken by motion, preſently a new Copula of the ſame kind of matter, apt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion, is joyned to them. For it is not poſſible, that the immenſe loſs of Spirits which happens in hard labours (if they were wholly deſtroyed) in ſo ſhort a time, ſhould be able to be reſtored by ſupplements coming only through the Nerves, We ſhall diſcourſe more largely of theſe things, if at any time hereafter we ſhall treat of the Motions of the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>The animal Spirits being diſpoſed within the ſeveral Muſcles, according to the ſeries of Fibres, ſeem as it were ſo many diſtinct Troops or Companies of Souldiers; all which being ſet as it were in a Watch-tower, are ordained, as a new impreſſion is carried to them by the Nerves, either from the objects outwardly, or more inwardly from the Head, forthwith into various forms and peculiar orders for the performing of motion or ſenſe of this or that kind. The carriage or behaviour of theſe is worth the ſeeing in an animal newly killed and its skin taken off. For when life periſhes, and all the force of the Spirits flowing in through the Nerves hath quite ceaſed; yet the Spirits implanted into the whole Body breaking forth from the Muſcles, ſtill move and ſhake them, and force them into ſeveral Convulſions and trembling motions.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid we may gather, what the diſpoſition or order of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107014:93"/>animal Spirits may be in the whole animal Body: to wit, thoſe procreated in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſubſtance both of the Brain and Cerebel, are congregated into the middles of either, as it were into diſtinct Empories or Marts; and an expanſion being made in either, they cauſe certain interior powers of the ſenſitive Soul to be exerciſed; yet the ſame Spirits, affecting more room, enter the oblong Marrow (as it were the Cheſt, as hath been ſaid, of a muſical Organ) and ſill it full; within which flowing, they carry to and fro the impreſſions of ſenſible Things and the Inſtincts of Motions. From the oblong and ſpinal Marrow the ſame Spirits, unleſs when they are otherwiſe buſied, tending outwardly, flow towards the ſeveral parts of the whole Body; which notwithſtanding wandring ſo out of doors, becauſe they paſs through very ſtrait ways in their paſſage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o wit, the ſlender bodies of the Nerves, they break not forth in heaps, or in a thick troop, but only contracted orderly, and as it were by bands or diviſions: but they being carried beyond the extremities of the Nerves, and there poſſeſſing the Membranes, Muſcles, and other ſenſible parts, dilate themſelves as it were into a moſt ample field, and with a very diffuſe Army they dwell in the Pores and paſſages of the Fibres planted every where about; where alſo being endowed from the blood with new food, they become more lively and more expeditious or ready for the deſigned offices.</p>
                     <p>Here perhaps it may be demanded, how the animal Spirits, diffuſed in ſuch nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous troops through the habit of the Body, are able to be ſupplied by ſo ſtrait chanels of the Nerves? To which we reply, That thoſe which reſide more outwardly do not quickly evaporate, nor are remanded back by Circulation: wherefore when all the Fibres are filled by an influx of the Spirits made by little and little from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, very ſmall ſupplements ſuffice to repair their expence: For neither are thoſe dwelling more outwardly, for that they are repaired by the bloody food, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, though in frequent action.</p>
                     <p>Hence may be noted the difference between the diſtributions of the blood and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits. That Latex, becauſe it is reduced in a circle, its Veſſels are in the whole paſſage proportionated as to the bulk of the Trunk and the branchings ſent from it, to wit, ſo that the branches of the great Artery, being carried from the Heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at the leaſt ſo much of the blood, as the ſhoots reaching forth from them, into all the parts. But becauſe the animal Spirits, being once begotten and carried more outwardly, ſubſiſt longer there, and evaporate very ſlowly and by little and little; therefore the Veſſels carrying them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nerves, in reſpect of the Fibres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, are made much leſſer in proportion; leſt perhaps by too great a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the animal Spirits, and the too thick gathering of the freſh ones ſtill into the nervous parts, the Army of the Veterans, before inſtructed, ſhould be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo the orders of all being diſturbed, the exerciſes of the animal Function ſhould be performed any how. For indeed when at any time the Spirits are made too ſharp, ſo that being therefore ſtruck as it were with madneſs, they ruſh upon the nervous Syſtem with tumult and impetuoſity; from thence a great unquietneſs and continual throwing about of the Members are wont to be excited, to which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times madneſs and fury ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>In the order and ordination of the animal Spirits, ſuch as was but now deſcribed, the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or the Eſſence of the ſenſitive Soul conſiſts, to wit, which is only a certain <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> or ſhadowy ſubſiſtence of thoſe Spirits, which like Atoms or ſubtil Particles, being chained and adhering mutually one to another, are figured together in a certain Species. Moreover, the faculties of the ſame Soul depend upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Metatheſis</hi> and geſticulation of thoſe Spirits within the aforeſaid Organs of the Head and nervous Syſtem. But the conſideration of this Soul and its powers requires a peculiar Tract, which hereafter (God willing) we intend; in the mean time, our Method demands of us, that (according to our weak skill) by the cenſe or numbering of the Nerves, being particularly made, we ſhould deliver an exact Neurology or Doctrine of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>But for that in the premiſed general conſideration of the Nerves and Fibres, there was mention made of the nervous and nutritious Juyce; notwithſtanding what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their powers and natures, hath been neither fully nor clearly enough deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; therefore we will a little divert here, and make it our buſineſs to inquire what ſort of Juyces and Humors are carried into the parts of the animated body for their nouriſhment, and by what ways or paſſages: then this difficulty being removed, a plain and eaſie way leads into the Doctrine of the Nerves.</p>

                           <hi>Of the Nervous Liquor, and whether that or the bloody Humor be Nutritious.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce the Circulation of the Blood was made known, and it hath been plainly made appear, that it did no where ſtagnate and ſtand ſtill long, but was carried in a reciprocal motion, always as in a circle; it began to grow doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its <hi>Latex</hi> is nutritious or not. For beſides, that the more rapid courſe of the blood, as of a torrent, might ſeem to wear the banks which it flowed between, and to carry away ſome Particles from them, rather than to be able to affix any thing to them; the ſubſtance it ſelf alſo of the blood, for that it is more torrid and uneven, is thought to be altogether unfit for nutrition. Wherefore that a Juyce may be found more convenient or fit for this office, the paſſages and hidden receſſes of the Nerves are to be viewed; and as a certain Latex is found to flow within their Pores and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, preſently the blood being rejected, that nervous humor is gifted with the title of nutritious: but yet by what right, and after what manner nutrition is performed, ſhall be our preſent purpoſe to inquire.</p>
                     <p>And here firſt of all, that we may take the part of the blood, it will be eaſie to ſhew, that there is matter contained in it fit enough for the nouriſhment of the body, and a ſufficient ſtore of it. For beſides the ſulphureous ſubſtance of the blood, which within the fire place of the Heart, with a continual inkindling, and by that means deflagration in the Veſſels produces life, and in the more perfect Animals heat, there is found alſo a certain other humor ſoft and alible, which in the Circulation, being diſtributed through ſeveral parts of the Body, by increaſing them adds nouriſhment and bulk: yea the deflagration it ſelf of the blood, plainly as a Kitchin-fire in dreſſing meat, as it were boils and prepares this humor, whereby it more eaſily is aſſimilated into the ſubſtance of every part to be nouriſhed. Hence it comes to paſs, that by reaſon of a defect of heat in the blood, no leſs than of exceſs, nutrition is often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. But that this kind of alible Juyce is contained in the bloody maſs, the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> or ſpontaneous <hi>Analyſis</hi> of its <hi>Latex</hi> ſufficiently declares; for the extravaſated blood, when it goes into parts of its own accord, this liquor being disjoyned from the purple thick part, and ſwimming a-top of it, appears clear or limpid; but by reaſon of its more thick contents, to wit, the nutritious Particles, like the white of an Egg, it is eaſily made thick, and grows white by a gentle heat: which thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this familiar Experiment, to wit, if you ſhall evaporate a little of it only in a Skillet over the fire, the whole liquor will preſently grow together into a white Gelly. By this liquor, as the blood is more or leſs imbued with it, living Creatures grow and become more fleſhy or lean: for both the blood of younger Animals being looſned from cold, is wont to ſhew much more of this kind of white than more ancient or older Creatures; and we may take notice daily at our Tables, that very much of this kind of Gelly comes out of the fleſh of a Lamb or Calf being boiled or roaſted, and nothing almoſt from Mutton or Beef, eſpecially if old. Therefore we may lawfully ſuppoſe, that the blood is truly nouriſhable; and that the whole, or at leaſt the greateſt part of the matter, for the adding bulk or ſubſtance to every part, is diſpenſed from it: but if at any time it be defective in this its office, that happens not out of the natural unfitneſs of it, but becauſe its diſpoſition is ſometimes depraved, and as the Stomach labouring with ſome vice, rejects or perverts the Chyle to be cooked by it.</p>
                     <p>But the blood, as it is not the only and alone humor, which is diſtributed in the animated Body, ſo neither ſeems it able to perform alone and of it ſelf the whole office of nutrition. For beſides that, being diffuſed through the Arteries and Veins, another Latex is every where diſpenſed from the Head through the Nerves; which ſhall be ſhewn to afford ſomething at leaſt to nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, there are many reaſons which declare that kind of humor to be in the Brain and nervous ſtock, and to abound in their whole paſſages. For unleſs the animal Spirits, continually flowing out, ſhould be founded in ſuch a Latex, which is their Vehicle, they would not be contiguous or joyned, nor able to continue and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107014:94"/>knit together the <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> of the ſenſitive Soul. For if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did obſerve long ſince, that Cramps and Convulſive motions were produced from drineſs and emptineſs, that perhaps might happen by this means: to wit, becauſe the humor in the Nerves or Fibres being deficient, the Spirits diſtracted one from another, were ſeparated; which notwithſtanding, that they might ſtill retain their mutual embraces, and as it were folding of hands, bend the containing bodies, and very much contract, and ſo force them into Convulſions. Beſides, Wounds and Impoſtumes of the Tendons and nervous parts ſeem to witneſs the diffuſion of the nervous Juyce, either of which drop forth a thin Ichor, and wholly unlike to the mere bloody Excretion: no leſs may be argued from the Ganglia and Evil running Sores. In time of ſleeping the aforeſaid humor is wont to flow more plentifully into the Brain and Nerves, and to obſtruct their paſſages; and therefore yawnings and ſtretchings come frequently upon thoſe awaking, that its reliques might be ſhook off. Laſtly, we might readily ſhew, that from the depravation of the nervous humor, Melancholy, Madneſs, and ſome wonderful Convulſive diſtempers proceed. But it may be objected, that there is no ſuch kind of humor, becauſe the Nerves being cut aſunder, it is not perceived to flow out; and that the Nerves being alſo bound, they do not ſwell above the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Arteries and Veins. But it may be anſwered, That the liquor flowing in the nervous ſtock, is very ſubtil and ſpirituous, and which, by any ſtriving or wrinkling up of thoſe parts, when they are roughly handled, may eaſily evaporate and be blown away or diſperſed unperceivably. Then further, 'tis obſerved in the Whelps of ſome Animals newly litter'd, who have as yet that juyce viſcous, and not eaſily to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and that have their Nerves greater, if they be bound hard together with cords, they will ſwell above the Ligature.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſeeing it appears, that a certain Humor doth creep through the blind Pipes and paſſages of the Head and of the Appendix, both medullar and nervous, it behoves us next of all to inquire from whence that comes thither, and whither it tends; and laſtly, of what kind of nature and uſe it is. Concerning theſe firſt it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from what hath been ſaid, that the aforeſaid Latex, ſerving for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, is perpetually inſtilled, together with them, from the blood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the exterior confines of the Brain and Cerebel, which from thence, paſſing through the medullar Trunk, is afterwards, with a gentle ſpring, poured through the whole frame of the nervous Syſtem; ſo that the firſt fountains of the nervous humor are in the Brain and Cerebel. But further, to this Juyce conveying the forces of the animal Spirits, and ſupplied only from the Head, there joyns a certain other humor, as it were auxiliar in the whole paſſage, and reſtores and refreſhes it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe about to grow deficient.</p>
                     <p>We think that theſe kind of ſupplements and ſubſidies, which happen to come from elſewhere to the nervous Juyce flowing from the Head, are received and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted inwardly from the ſides and extremities of the medullar and nervous Syſtem. We have already ſhewed that an humor, as it were ſecondary, is inſtilled from the blood watering theſe parts in its whole paſſage; becauſe the Arteries follow not only the medullar Trunk, but alſo the greater Trunks of the Nerves in many places, and inſert into them ſanguiferous ſhoots. Beſides, foraſmuch as the animal Spirits flowing within the nervous ſtock for the performing of ſenſe and motion, tend to and fro, and ſo bear a double aſpect; it is probable alſo, that the liquor watering the Nerves, as it moſt commonly tends forward, ſo ſometimes backward; and ſo that the extremities of the Nerves, implanted in ſome parts, imbibe from them the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, at leaſt ſome Effluvia's, with which they are ſatisfied, and oftentimes transfer them into the Brain it ſelf. Certainly there is no doubt, that the Fibres and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Filaments or threads which cover the Senſory of taſte, and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſerving for Concoction, do immediately receive ſome taſtes of the taken in food, from which ſupplies are carried to the Brain it ſelf in great hunger and ſaintneſs of Spirits. Becauſe if at any time the Spirits inhabiting it, being exhauſted very much with heavy and long labour, begin to ſail, a moſt ſwift refection is performed, Pectorals or Cordials being ſcarcely ſwallowed, and long indeed before the alible Juyce can be able to reach to the border of the Brain by the paſſage of the blood. Moreover it is moſt likely, that not only the benign Effluvia's of the aliment are received by the extremities of the Nerves ending about the <hi>Viſcera;</hi> but alſo by this way, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an infeſtous matter, and in a manner malignant, is communicated by the Nerves and their paſſages to the Head. But indeed the preternatural Juyces heaped up about
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107014:94"/>the Hypochondria, the Spleen, Womb, and other Bowels emit vaporous little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which not only infect the bloody maſs, and diſtemper the Head by that means, but they climb to the Brain more immediately by the paſſage of the Nerves, and ſtrike it with an heavy ill. For from hence in part it comes, that Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacks and Hyſterical people are ſo cruelly puniſhed through the Symptoms ſtirred up in the Brain and nervous ſtock for the faults of the lower Bowels; hence it is, that little Pills of Opium, being ſcarcely diſſolved in the Stomach, cauſe a Torpor or heavineſs. But here is no place to diſcourſe more largely of theſe. It behoves us to conſider what remains, the Springs of the nervous Juyce, the Auxiliaries but now detected, and its Virtues and Influences.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the nervous Liquor we ſhall inquire what that doth in its paſſage, to wit, whilſt it flows within the Marrows or middles of the Brain and Cerebel, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar Trunk and the bodies themſelves of the Nerves: ſecondly, then for what uſes, it ſerves, when being ſliden from the ends of the Nerves, it is ſpread abroad on the ſecondary parts of the nervous Syſtem.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, whilſt that of the nervous Liquor paſſes through the Head, and either of its Appendix, its chief office ſeems to be for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, which indeed it carries along with its diffuſion, and contains them under the ſame <hi>Syſtaſis.</hi> Yea, this Latex ſhews various Schemes of the Spirits for the performing of ſenſe and motion; even as the humid Particles of the Air paſs through the Optick Configurations of the Rays of Light. Alſo moreover, the nutrition of the aforeſaid parts and accretion or growth into a greater bulk, depends in ſome meaſure upon the nervous Juyce watering the ſame, as ſhall be ſhewed by and by.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But the greateſt queſtion is concerning this Liquor being diffuſed beyond the ends of the Nerves upon the ſecondary parts of the nervous Syſtem, and in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of them on the whole Body; to wit, whether ſuch a Juyce be nouriſhing of all the ſolid parts, or of ſome of them by themſelves, as Authors variouſly think; or to what other office it is deſtinated.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe it firſt appears, that the Brain and Nerves, with the Juyce flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, contribute matter, or at leaſt ſome influence to the work of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the which if it ſhould chance to fail (a ſign of which defect is, if the animal Faculty falters in part) the nouriſhment there is wont preſently to be hindred or perverted. This is plainly ſeen in the Palſie, excited from an evident cauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous Dyſcraſie of the blood, where ſuddenly an Atrophy follows the privation of motion or ſenſe, or of both together. Further, in the Scurvy, where the taint hath corrupted the nervous Juyce, when the ſick begin to be afflicted with the Vertigo and ſwimming of the Head, and with wandring pains, Convulſions, and a frequent looſning of the Members, the fleſh falls preſently away, as in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and without any fault of the Lungs, the ſick wither away, as if diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with a Phthiſis. It is a vulgar obſervation, That from the immoderate uſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> alſo from an inveterate Gonorhrea, from Strumous or running Ulcers, and other Impoſtumes, by which much of the nervous Juyce is waſted, a leanneſs or waſting of the whole Body is produced. Certainly, if I be not deceived, there are ſome Atrophies, yea, and ſorts of breakings out, which ſeem to depend wholly upon the defect or the evil diſpenſation of the nervous Juyce, when the blood, as to its quantity and diſpoſition, is not much in fault. Laſtly, the conſideration of ſome Diſeaſes and Symptoms ſo plainly confirms the diffuſion of the nervous Liquor and its great influence on all the parts, that there is even left no room for doubting.</p>
                     <p>Alſo no leſs doth the curing of ſome Diſeaſes and the uſe of Remedies confirm the ſame. For from hence a reaſon is taken, wherefore Cephalick Plaſters oftentimes yield ſuch ſignal help in the <hi>Phthiſis;</hi> not becauſe they ſtay the <hi>Catarrh</hi> of the Serum falling down on the Lungs, (as the common people think) but becauſe by corroborating the Brain they reſtore the diſpoſition of the nervous Juyce, before vitiated. For this cauſe it is, that ſome diſeaſes being ſtirred up by the fault of the nervous Liquor, of which ſort among others are Cancrous and Strumous Ulcers, or ſuch as come of the Kings-Evil, are hardeſt of all to be cured; becauſe the morbid tincture of the Brain, and of the <hi>Latex</hi> watering it (whether it be innate or acquired) is not eaſily mended: yet ſometimes when the root of the diſeaſe, lurking in the Brain or nervous ſtock, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the help of Nature it ſelf, or by Chance, by the uſe of ſome remedy; preſently the Symptoms of other parts, though neglected in the whole, vaniſh, not without the ſuſpicion of a miracle. But how much the alteration of the Brain ſerves
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107014:95"/>for the curing of ſome moſt grievous diſeaſes, ſome inſtances taken from the Farriers Art will clearly ſhew.</p>
                     <p>For when many Medicines and Methods of Adminiſtrations are wont to be tryed in vain for the curing the ſtinking diſeaſe in Horſes, commonly called the <hi>Farcy</hi> (which <hi>Helmontius</hi> aſſerts to be like the French Pox, and the Author of its Contagion) the moſt certain means of curing (which I have very often known to be applied with good ſucceſs) conſiſts in this; that ſome ſharp Medicines, of which ſort are Hearts-eaſe, Water-Pepper, Ranunculus or Crowfoot, and the like, which very much abound in volatile Salt, being bruiſed into a maſs, and put into the Ears of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Horſe, and kept there for twenty four hours: it is ſcarce credible by what means all the Ulcers are preſently dryed up, and the diſeaſe healed, as it were by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, is quickly profligated in the whole. For ſince this Application is made far from the affected parts, without any alteration of the bowels or the blood, it ſhould be ſo healed at a diſtance; certainly the cauſe of ſuch an Energy muſt only be, that by this kind of Medicine the Dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition of the Brain and nervous Juyce is taken away, and ſo the firſt root of the ſickneſs being cut off, the ſhoots and fruits preſently wither. It were worth our labour to try ſuch kind of Experiments alſo in our Medicines. Yea it may be well ſuſpected, that ſuch a way ought to be ordered for the common Cure of the Kings-Evil. Among our Country-men, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from our Anceſtors, it is thought that the ſeventh Son, or he that is born the ſeventh one after another in a continued ſeries, can cure this diſeaſe by ſtroking it only with his hand; and truly I have known many, whom no Medicines could help, to have been cured in a ſhort time only by that remedy. Few doubt but that this diſeaſe is wont to be cured often by the Touch of our King. The reaſon of ſuch an effect (if it be merely natural) ought to be aſſigned not to any other thing than that in the ſick (eſpecially thoſe of ripe age) the Phantaſie and ſtrong Faith of the hoped for Cure induces that alteration, or rather ſtrengthning to the Brain, whereby the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid diſpoſition radicated in it is profligated. But I ſhall return from whence I am digreſſed, to inquire what the nervous Juyce contributes to nutrition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſay therefore ſecondly, although nutrition depends in ſome meaſure upon the influence of the nervous Juyce, yet it is highly improbable, that all the ſeveral parts of the whole Body ſhould be nouriſhed only by this proviſion. For beſides that this were to impoſe upon the Government of the Soul it ſelf, and its primary Organs, the cooking office of nutrition wholly unworthy the excellency and dignity of thoſe parts; it ſeems alſo that the nervous Liquor ſhould be altogether unfit for the adminiſtring to this Province: becauſe when oftentimes immenſe expences are made of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be aſſimilated into the ſubſtance of the ſolid parts, eſpecially by immoderate ſweat, alſo by continual labour and exerciſe, which Country-men and Labourers daily uſe, it is not poſſible that ſuch loſſes ſhould be repaired only by the nouriſhment ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, or ſent through the ſmall paſſages of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>When I had long and ſeriouſly conſidered with my ſelf concerning this thing, what I at length thought, I ſhall tell you freely, and without any covering, or making any reflection, or blaming the Opinions of others. It ſeems firſt, that the nouriſhing matter of the whole Body is diſtributed into all parts from the blood through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; yet it may lawfully be thought, that the converſion of this matter into nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, and the aſſimilation of it into the ſubſtance of the part to be nouriſhed, is performed by the influence and help of the nervous Juyce, as it were of a certain ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Ferment. As to the firſt: we have already noted, that the ſanguiferous Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels do not only follow almoſt every where the Muſcles and Bowels, but alſo the Head and its Appendix, yea the Membranes, Bones, and Nerves themſelves, and affix to them all thick ſhoots, as ſo many little chanels, for the receiving the nouriſhment. Moreover, as there is a purple craſſament or thick ſubſtance in the blood, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſtuffs and nouriſhes the Pores of the Parenchyma of the Muſcles; ſo there is a whitiſh Gelly, by which the Membranes and the whiter parts ſeem to increaſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it may be obſerved, that the blood it ſelf increaſing, contains in it ſelf fibres and ſmall threads, ſuch as are interwoven in the Muſcles and nervous parts; and if the ſame ſtand long in any Veſſel, it is preſently coagulated into longiſh, white, and hard cruſts or bits, whoſe ſubſtance is plainly fleſhy; ſo that the blood produces fleſh of it ſelf, though the ſame be rude and unformed: wherefore the configuration and the apt diſpoſition of the nouriſhing matter, ſupplied from it, depends on the coming and Energy of the nervous Juyce: but after what manner this is done, we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour now to ſhew.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:107014:95"/>
                     <p>After the web or ſtuff of all the parts is laid, it is required then that they be both drawn forth in due proportion, and grow in ſubſtance, and alſo that the little ſpaces which are left by reaſon of the Effluvia's perpetually falling off, may be continually filled with the nouriſhing ſubſtance caſt in. In theſe two things the buſineſs of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chiefly conſiſts; for the performing of either of which the blood affords matter, and reaches it forth (as was ſaid) in the circulating to the ſeveral parts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, and as it were ſtands at the doors of the part to be nouriſhed: yet, that this matter may be rightly diſpoſed, and its particles, to wit, the thick and thin, ſaline and ſulphureous, and others of a ſeveral nature, ſeparated one from another, may be imployed with ſome choice to the deſtinated uſes, there ſeems need of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain directing faculty, and as it were plaſtick virtue, got ſomewhere elſe than from the blood it ſelf. For indeed the blood being deſtitute of animal Spirits, is unfit for the performing theſe offices. Wherefore, for that it appears there doth lye hid in the nervous ſtock, a certain juyce, and the ſame being gifted with animal Spirit to be diffuſed to all parts, how can we ſuppoſe leſs but that this ſubtil and ſpirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, every where meeting with the arterious, which is duller and thicker, actuates and inſpires it, and as it were ordains it for the performing the deſigned work of nutrition? eſpecially when it plainly appears, that by reaſon of the defect or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this nervous Juyce, nutrition is always fruſtrated or perverted.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it may be lawful, in the difficult Controverſie concerning the Matter and Method of Cure, to propoſe this our Hypotheſis, though it be a Paradox and very abſtruſe; to wit, that the nervous Juyce (which we have ſaid was like the male ſeed) is poured out with the nutritious humor copiouſly ſuggeſted from the Arteries, as it were the genitive or ſeed of another Sex, every where upon all the parts; and that this former, being indued with active Elements, imbues the more thick matter, as with a certain Ferment, and impregnates it with animal Spirit; and when it ſo makes it, with a mutual entring in or coming together, to be diſſolved and to go into parts, its particles being extricated one from the other (the Spirit infuſed help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) they are put upon bodies of the ſame meaſure with themſelves, and are aſſimilated into their ſubſtances. In the mean time, becauſe the animal Spirits are poured out in great plenty with the nervous Juyce, thoſe which are at leiſure from the work of nutrition, or remain after that is finiſhed, turn aſide every where into the Fibres, as into proper dwelling houſes, and there being ready for the offices of ſenſe and motion, ſtay; which offices indeed, that thoſe Spirits the Inhabitants of the Fibres, may the better perform, they acquire from the blood watering the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, certain auxiliary forces, wherefore they being endued with a certain elaſtick force, are apt to be highly rarified and as it were exploded.</p>
                     <p>But indeed we ſuppoſe, that as the nervous Liquor, being turgid with animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cauſes the arterious humor to become nutritious; ſo in compenſation of this the animal Spirits remaining of the work of nutrition, and every where diſpoſed within the Fibres, receive from the arterious blood a mixture or certain Copula; by whoſe help and cooperation the ſame Spirits exert or put forth much more ſtrongly their locomotive force. For it ſeems that little ſulphureous bodies are added to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous-ſaline particles from the watering blood; and ſo when the animal Spirits are furniſhed with this Copula, they being ſtirred up into motion, ſhake off the borrowed particles, which being ſtruck with a certain force, like the exploſion of Gun-powder, ſuddenly intumifie the Muſcles, and ſo by contracting them very much, they cauſe a vehement motive endeavour. We ſhall have an occaſion of diſcourſing more at large of this, when we treat of the Motion of the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>Yet in the mean time, we ſhall take notice, that the Muſcles of the whole Body, as to their motion, have a certain Analogy with the motion of the Heart. For indeed the animal Spirits in the Heart, flowing within the fibres and nervous threads, (with which this part is much beſet) receive plentifully ſulphureous little bodies from the inflowing blood diſtending the ſides of either boſom, which whilſt the ſame Spirits, being filled to a fulneſs, ſhake off and as it were explode, a <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the whole Heart (its ſides being carried with a certain force inwards) is brought in or cauſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the blood, from either ſide the boſom, is caſt out as it were by the impulſe of a Spring or Bolt. Truly, unleſs the Spirits inhabiting the Heart, ſhould receive food and matter of exploſion from the blood it ſelf, their ſtock, ſupplied or ſent by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the few and ſmall Nerves, would not ſuffice for the performing of the undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued motion. A ſign of this is, that from a defect or depravation of the blood,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107014:96"/>as well as of the animal Spirits, the motion alſo of the Heart is defective or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And not much unlike in the Muſcles, as in the Heart, is the buſineſs performed; the Spirits inhabiting their Fibres, receive a ſulphureous Copula and apt for explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from the blood there more plentifully flowing than about the Membranes, with which being endued, as often as they receive from the Nerve as it were the fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling or the match, the inſtinct of the motion to be performed, they being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and ſtriking of their Copula, very much inflate or blow up the Muſcle, and intumifie it for performing or compaſſing the motive endeavour. Nor is it much to purpoſe, or makes any great difference, that the motion of the Heart, ſtirred up by a perpetual inſtinct, is found always neceſſary; but the Muſcles the moſt of them only occaſionally and at the command of the Animal, do put forth their motive power; for the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and ſome Muſcles, dedicated to Reſpiration, are urged with a perpetual <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> as well as the Heart it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>From the aforeſaid Hypotheſis concerning the offices and uſes of the nervous and arterious Juyce, Arguments that otherwiſe determine the work of Nutrition, may be eaſily anſwered. For that the blood is ſaid rather to prey upon the ſolid parts than to repleniſh them, that ought to be attributed to the Diſeaſe and Dyſcraſie of it, and not to it ſimply: becauſe ſometimes the blood is accuſed, for that it too much ſtuffs the ſolid parts; to wit, foraſmuch as its maſs being wateriſh and weak, it lays aſide the alible Juyce (which not being truly cook'd, is ſtill crude and vicious) with very great plenty about the habit of the Body, and ſo induces an <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> In the mean time it ought to be granted, That as it is the blood that is evil which heaps up too much vicious nutriment; ſo it is the ſame, which being well and right, doth lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perform the office of Nutrition.</p>
                     <p>But that it is argued, That the nervous is rather the nouriſhing Juyce, becauſe by reaſon of its defect, depravation or too prodigal expence, the acts of nutrition are wont to be hindred or perverted; it is eaſie to reply to this, That the impediments of the nervous Juyce, being made vicious, reſpect the form of nouriſhment, and not the matter of it: to wit, it ſometimes happens, that the blood diſpenſes the alible matter in due plenty and diſpoſition; which notwithſtanding, by the fault of the nervous Juyce, is not rightly aſſimilated. When an impotency of motion comes upon a too great diſtenſion of the Muſcle or Tendon with pain, ſhortly nutrition being hindred, a Jelly grows about the diſtempered part: which notwithſtanding drops not out of the Nerve (as is commonly ſaid) but the glutinous humor being poured out of the Arteries for aliment, for that it cannot be received by the hurt part, is gathered together there: nor is it to be thought, that Tumors, or Strumous Ulcers or the running Sores of the Evil do contain or pour out only a nervous humor, ſince the matter of either is for the moſt part bloody, which by reaſon of the evil Ferment of the nervous Juyce, puts on a ſtrange form, and that diverſly degenerous.</p>
                     <p>This ſuppoſition of the twofold Humor, for the matter and form of nouriſhment, is taken to be of egregious uſe for the ſolving of the moſt difficult Phaenomena, which are met with about the Diſtempers of the Brain and nervous Juyce: yea, that Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, ſeriouſly conſidered, ſeems to infer as a certain neceſſary conſequence, that a twofold Juyce is neceſſary for the work of Nutrition; as ſome other time perhaps we may ſhew. In the mean time, leaving this Speculation, we ſhall proceed to the remaining Task of our <hi>Anatomy,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Neurologie</hi> or of the Nerves in particular.</p>

                           <hi>The firſt four Pair of Nerves ariſing within the Skull are deſcribed.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE diviſion or diſtinction of the Nerves, by reaſon of their various reſpects, is wont to be manifold: to wit, as they are either ſoft or hard, ſingular or numerous in their beginnings; or that they ſerve either to the faculty of Senſe, or Motion, or to both together. But they are commonly diſtinguiſhed, That ſome Nerves ariſing within the Skull, proceed from the oblong Marrow; and others going out of the joynts of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> are derived from the ſpinal Marrow. But beſides theſe, another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of differencing them ſeems beſt to us; to wit, That ſome Nerves, as it were Clients and Servants of the Brain, perform only ſpontaneous Acts, and others, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Servants of the Cerebel, are imployed only about the exerciſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary Function. There will be no need to aſſign different Eſſences or Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nerves according to theſe ſeveral differences: but rather that there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a particular Cenſe or Muſter of them, and following the order of Nature, that we eſpecially unfold every one of them in the ſeries in which they are diſpoſed in the animal Body.</p>
                     <p>Among the Nerves ariſing from the Skull, the ſmelling Nerves, or thoſe which are commonly called the Mammillary Proceſſes, lead the way; for that they have their riſe before all the reſt, and are ſtretched out forward beyond the Brain it ſelf. Theſe Nerves go out of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow within the chamfered bodies and chambers of the Optick Nerves; and being endued with a manifeſt cavity, open into the firſt Ventricle of the Brain on either ſide behind the ſame chamfered bodies; ſo that the humidity flowing between the folding of the Brain, is carried through theſe chanels into the mammillary Proceſſes; whether they go farther forward, ſhall be anon inquired into: Becauſe theſe Nerves being broad and large, ariſing near the chamfered bodies, and from thence ſtretched forward under the Baſis of the Brain, their bulk is increaſed by degrees till they go into the round Proceſſes like Paps, by which either boſom of the Cribrous or Sieve-like Bone is beſmeared. Within the Socket of this Bone theſe Nerves, as yet ſoft and tender, obtain Coats of the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> with which being divided into many fibres and filaments, and paſſing through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone, they go out of the Skull: from whence being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or carried forward into the caverns of the Noſtrils, and diſtributed on every ſide, they are inſerted into the Membrane beſpreading thoſe Labyrinths.</p>
                     <p>If we inquire into the nature and uſe of theſe parts, without doubt the mammillary
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107014:97"/>Proceſſes and their medullar roots, with the fibres and ſmall threads hanging to the ſame, are truly Nerves, and ſerve properly for the very Organ of the Smell. Seeing theſe conduce to the ſenſe only without any local motion, therefore (even as the other hearing Nerve) whilſt they are within the Skull, they are plainly medullar and ſoft; whereby the animal Spirits more eaſily moved within the more tender ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Nerves, might convey more readily and accurately to the common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory the Ideas or forms of the ſenſible Species: But becauſe the effluvia's or odorous breaths to be received by the naked Organ, carry oftentimes with them ſharp and pricking Particles hurtful to the Brain and Nerves; therefore in the firſt courſe theſe Nerves being about to go out of the Skull, borrow Coats from the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which ſerve for Armour. Further, as theſe breaths (leſt they ſhould ſtrike more ſharply by ruſhing impetuouſly on the Senſory) being admitted only by little and little, and by ſmall bands, ought to be brought through divers narrow turnings and windings of the Noſtrils; therefore that theſe Nerves may the better receive the effluvia's flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the ſeveral dens, they are ſo divided into very many fibres and ſmall threads or filaments, that there may be no paſſage of the Noſtrils to which at leaſt ſome of them are not deſtinated. And after this manner, although the exhalations, as it were torn into little Clouds, are received by the nervous filaments, and ſo care is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, that they being more thickly elevated, may not overwhelm or obſcure the Senſory; yet leſt any thing ſharp and troubleſom ſhould be carried with them to the Brain, the cribrous bone is ſet before the doors as an obſtacle, through whoſe little holes being ſtrained, they may put off all ſharpneſs. And laſtly, they being carried through the ſofter Nerve, as it were another Medium, and ſo broken again, they at length being ſoft and gentle enough, are ſtaid at the firſt Senſory.</p>
                     <p>But that theſe Nerves are noted through the whole with an open hollowneſs within the Skull, the reaſon ſeems to be, that the watry humor ſtilling out of the foldings of the Brain, and being derived into thoſe chanels, might beat back and temper the impreſſions of the odours, when too ſharp and fiery: for as the humors included in the Eye, variouſly refract the viſible Species, whereby it paſſing at laſt through the Optick Nerve without any force, ſlides pleaſantly to the common Senſory; ſo it is not improbable, that the water contained within theſe paſſages of the Nerve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, does in like manner ſweeten the ſpecies of the odours, and prepare them in ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eaſure for the Senſory. Wherefore it is obſerved, that Cattle and Beaſts which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d with herbage, have the mammillary Proceſſes exceeding large and always full of water; to wit, leſt the odours of the herbs continually attracted by them (unleſs their force ſhould be blunted after the aforeſaid manner) might hurt or overthrow their more weak brain. Beſides, it is very likely that this watry juyce falling down from the infolding of the Brain, doth not only flow into the open chanels of the Nerves and the mammillary Proceſſes, but alſo doth paſs through by the paſſage of the fibres and filaments the holes of the Sieve-like Bone, and doth wet and continually moiſten the cavities of the Noſtrils, apt to be dryed or torrified too much by the Air thither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and by the breath continually blown out. For it clearly appears, as we have elſewhere ſhewn, that the ſerous humors creep through the blind paſſages of the Nerves and Fibres, and by them wander from place to place. Yea it may be thought, that not only water, ſufficient for the watering the Noſtrils, doth by this way ſweat through; but alſo whenſoever the ſerous heap is gathered together in the Ventricles of the Brain, its ſuperfluities or the excrementitious humor doth very often paſs through the cribrous Bone by the paſſage of the Fibres, and is ſent out. But we have in another place diſcourſed more largely of this.</p>
                     <p>The ſmelling Nerves, which have within the Skull their mammillary Proceſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on them, are much greater in an Ox, Goat, and in Cattle, and ſuch like beaſts that live on herbage, than in fleſh-eating Animals; to wit, becauſe in thoſe there ſeems to be more need of the ſenſe of ſmelling to be more exquiſite for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the virtues of the manifold herbs. Alſo theſe Nerves are larger in all Brutes than in Man: the reaſon of which is, becauſe they diſcern things only by the ſenſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their food by the ſmell; but Man learns many things by education or nurture and diſcourſe, and is rather led by the taſte and ſight, than by the ſmell in chuſing his aliments. Theſe Nerves in Birds, as alſo in Fiſhes, are conſpicuous enough; for either of theſe, even as four-footed beaſts, ſeek out and chuſe their food by the help or knowledge of the ſmell.</p>
                     <p>As to the Fibres and Filaments or little ſtrings ſtretching out from the more ſoft
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107014:97"/>Nerves through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone into the caverns of the Noſe, theſe are found in all Creatures who have the mammillary Proceſſes: ſo that it is not to be doubted, but that theſe Proceſſes, with this Appendix and its medullary origine, is the Organ of the Smell. And what more confirms this thing, theſe filaments or little ſtrings are far more, and more remarkable in hunting Hounds than in any other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal whatſoever. But beſides theſe Nervulets drawn through the holes of the Sieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Bone into the Noſtrils, two branches alſo are ſent hither from the fifth pair, and diſtributed into both the Noſtrils. The reaſon of this ſeems to be, becauſe though the Nerves but now deſcribed, or of the firſt Conjugation, are properly ſmelling Nerves, and effect by themſelves the ſenſe of Smelling; yet theſe are aſſiſted or joyned with other Nerves, alſo by thoſe ſent from the fifth pair, becauſe the Organ of the Smell ought to have a conſent with all other parts, which thoſe ſubſidiary Nerves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the manifold branching out of the fifth pair, are wont to perform. It chiefly appears, that there is a certain nearneſs or ſtrict affinity between the taſte and the ſmell: and the cauſe of this conſiſts, in that out of the ſame Trunk of the fifth pair certain Nerves are ſent to the Palate, and others to the Noſtrils. Concerning the reaſon of that wonderful conſent which the Noſtrils have with the <hi>Praecordia</hi> in ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alſo wherefore that light titillation ſtirs up a Cough, ſhall be ſpoken of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when we come to unfold the fifth pair and the intercoſtal Nerves. But in the mean time we ſhall take notice, that although many Nerves belong to the Organ of Smelling, yet that ſenſe is properly performed by the Fibres interwoven in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coat of the Noſtrils: for thoſe Fibres being ſtruck by the ſenſible object, move and contract themſelves variouſly according to the Idea of the impreſſion; which Affection of them being carried by the paſſage of the Nerves to the Head, foraſmuch as it is there ſtaid by the common Senſory, cauſes the perception of the ſenſe. Thoſe ſenſible Fibres are diverſly figured in ſeveral Animals; which is the reaſon, why odorous things do not alike affect all Animals. For what things by a mans noſtrils, as endured with too ſharp and pricking Effluvia's, are eſteemed highly naught and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as eſpecially are dung and putrid fleſh; the ſame are to Dogs, whoſe Organ of Smelling is made or conſiſts of more robuſt or ſtrong Fibres, and proportionate to thoſe Effluvia's, as very grateful and choſen for food.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Conjugation are the Optick or ſeeing Nerves: concerning which we have ſhewn already, in the Anatomy of the Brain, after what manner they ariſe from behind the chamſered bodies out of the ſecond ſection of the medullar ſhanks (which <hi>Galen</hi> calls the <hi>Chamber</hi> of the Optick Nerve) and deſcending from thence with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain compaſs are united, and being again ſeparated and carried into the Ball of the Eyes, conſtitute with diffuſed Fibres the hard Coat. Moreover, in thoſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we did but now take notice, that the Trunk of this Nerve growing a little hard without the Skull, was as it were a little bundle of very many Fibres or ſmall ſtrings growing together into one, and of produced Parallels, as it ſhould ſeem for that end, that the animal Spirits, flowing in the whole Nerve, might be moved in ſo many lines or direct rays; to wit, whereby they may carry the viſible Species, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refracted in the Eye, thence to the common Senfory by a direct beam, and not intorted or rolled about.</p>
                     <p>As often as in the diſtempers of the Eyes blackiſh pricks or concatenated pieces of any thing ſeem to be rolled before the Eyes, it is likely that this apparition is ſo made, becauſe certain filaments or ſmall ſtrings of the Optick Nerve are ſhut up, which when the light cannot paſs through rightly, as through the reſt, ſo many as it were ſhadowy ſpaces appear in the middle of the clearneſs. Theſe Nerves, becauſe they only ſerve for the ſenſe, are therefore more ſoft within the Skull: but becauſe there may be need perhaps, that the Trunk of this Nerve ought to be ſometimes dilated or ſpread abroad, ſometimes bound cloſe together or contracted according to the divers appearance and incourſe of the objects; therefore very many Fibres, being ſent out from the motory or moving Nerves of the Eyes, do every where compaſs and bind it about, and entring with it into the Ball of the Eye, are inſerted partly near the root of the Optick Nerve, and partly penetrate more deeply the Sclerotick or hard Coat it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Further, the Optick Nerves are not only bound or environed with nervous Fibres ſent from the third pair, but (as we have ſhewn above) with ſanguiferous Veſſels in their whole proceſs. The office of which certainly is, both that there might be every where about the greater Trunk of this Nerve as it were a continual heat or ſufficient
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107014:98"/>fire-place; alſo perhaps, that the food of the bloody humor might be ſupplied to the Spirits, living there within the trunks of the nerves, far from the fountain, as is wont to be in other places.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Fabrick of the Eye it ſelf, and manner of ſeeing, alſo concerning the whole dioptrick proviſion, here ſeems a fit opportunity of diſcourſing: but this were to digreſs too far from our purpoſe, to wit, the mere or naked Doctrine of the Nerves; and I may the better paſs by this addition, becauſe this Province hath been ſufficiently and accurately adorned by others. In the mean time we ſhall take notice, that as in the ſmelling, ſo alſo in ſeeing, the ſenſe is performed, not ſo much by the help of the nerve, as of the fibres, which are interwoven with the organ: to wit, the little fibres in the Membranes of the Eyes, and eſpecially thoſe inſerted into the Sclerotick Coat, and diſpoſed after the manner of a net, do receive the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the viſible Species, and by repreſenting the image of the thing, ſo as it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without, cauſes ſight. But it is the office of the nerve it ſelf to tranſmit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as it were by the paſſage of the Optick Pipe, that image or ſenſible Species, and to carry it to the common Senſory.</p>
                     <p>The third Conjugation of Nerves are the moving nerves of the Eyes, which ariſe in the Baſis of the medullar Stem behind the Tunnel; from whence going forwards nigh the pair of ſeeing nerves, and going out of the Skull with the other nerves deſtinated to the Eye, they are carried towards the Globe of the Eye; where, being preſently divided into many branches, they provide it with moving Muſcles; but with various difference in divers living Creatures. For in an Ox, who hath got a larger eye, the moving nerve of the eye imparts a branch to every one of the ſix common Muſcles; and beſides, from the nerves of the fourth, fifth, and ſixth pair certain branches are diſtributed to ſome of the ſame Muſcles: ſo that, as often as any Animal intends or applies the ſenſe for the perceiving of this or that object, theſe nerves turn about the Eye, and compoſe it at their pleaſure for the ſpontaneous beholding of the ſame. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we take notice, that the Eyes do get a diverſe kind of involuntary motion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Fear, Shame, Anger, Sadneſs, yea and in all Affections of the Head and Heart, whether we will or no, the Eyes are reſpectively figured. Wherefore 'tis highly probable, that theſe kind of pathetick motions of the Eyes, whereof the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature is ſcarce knowing, are performed by the help of the other nerves, to wit, of thoſe coming from the fourth, fifth and ſixth pair: and that more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears, becauſe the ſame nerves which lend their branches to the Eye, take their origines from the Cerebel, the office of which we have often ſhewn to be, to diſpenſe the Spirits for the exerciſe of the involuntary Function.</p>
                     <p>But concerning theſe Nerves of the third pair, which are properly called the Moving nerves of the Eyes, we obſerve, that in Man, a Dog, and in ſome other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are found to be ſomewhat otherwiſe than in an Ox: for either nerve in theſe, as in the reſt, is carried out of the Skull, divided into four branches, three of which are carried from thence into three ſtraight diſtinct Muſcles, to wit, one lifting up, the other bringing together, the third preſſing cloſe the Eye; the other branch of it goes forwards further with a ſingle trunk, and is implanted in the middle of the Muſcle going about the Eye, turning obliquely to the inward corner down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. From theſe it appears, that theſe Muſcles, to which this nerve belongs in all, are ſufficient almoſt of themſelves to perform moſt ſpontaneous motions of the Eye: but where the aforeſaid nerve is divided into four ſhoots, it conſtitutes a ſmall and round infolding, out of which many ſmall ſhoots creep through, and variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs about the trunk of the Optick nerve; for what uſe it is ſo made, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intimated.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Conjugation of Nerves (which we call rightly the Fourth by order and ſucceſſion, although it is accounted the eighth and laſt by <hi>Fallopius</hi>) hath a diverſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from all the reſt. For whereas moſt of the others proceed from the foot or ſides of the oblong Marrow, this hath its root in the top of it behind the round Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes:</hi> From whenc, bending more forward nigh the ſides of the oblong Marrow, it is preſently hid under the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> under which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along for ſome ſpace, and paſſing through the Skull at the ſame hole with the reſt deſtinated to the Eye, it is beſtowed with a ſingle trunk, not communicating with any of the other nerves, wholly on the Muſcle called the <hi>Trochlear</hi> Muſcle. Above we called theſe nerves the <hi>Patheiick</hi> nerves of the Eyes: for although ſome beſides may deſerve this name, (as ſhall be ſhewn by and by) yet 'tis moſt likely, that the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107014:98"/>proper office of theſe is to move the Eyes pathetically, according to the force of the Paſſions and inſtinct of Nature, delivered and remanded from the Brain to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and ſo on the contrary, from this to that through the <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> and their medullar Proceſſes. For, as we have ſhewn, that by the diverſe impulſe and waving of the animal Spirits dwelling in this by-path, there are inſtituted certain mutual commerces between the Brain and the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> (the Cerebel mediating between either) it will be of neceſſity, that theſe nerves, rooted in the middle way, ſhould be ſtruck by every tending downwards or remove of the Spirits, going this way or that way, and ſo the motions of the Eyes to follow the affections of thoſe parts. All perfect Animals are furniſhed with theſe nerves; and in truth, as none of them but are obnoxious to Anger, Love, Hatred, and other Affections, ſo every little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhew theſe by the mere aſpect and by the geſture it ſelf of the Eyes. We ſee ſometimes the greater Pike gaping for his prey firſt of all to roll about his eyes, and to look ſour; then with a ſwiſt ſhooting out of his body to invade the leſſer fry of fiſh.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>OF the aforeſaid four Pair of Nerves, the two former ſeem chiefly to ſerve for the Senſe only, but the two latter for Motion; and every ſingle nerve of them deſtinated to a peculiar Province: but this which follows next, to wit, the fifth Conjugation of Nerves ſerves for the exerciſe of either Faculty, to wit, both of Senſe and Motion; nor is its Province ſo ſtrictly bounded, that it ſhould belong only to one member, for it is diſtributed to the Eyes, Noſe, and Palate, and the reſt of the parts of the Face; and beſides, helps in its part in ſome ſort the offices and actions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and almoſt of all the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This pair (which by the Ancients was accounted the third, by us the fifth pair, and that by right of order or poſition) below the former nerves, proceeds with a broad and large trunk from the ſides of the annular Protuberance or Proceſs ſent out from the Cerebel. It conſiſts of very many Fibres gathered together, ſome of which are ſoft, others hard; ſo that the great trunk of it near its beginning, is nothing elſe than a little bundle of very many nerves, ſome of which are beſtowed on theſe parts, and others on other parts, and in ſome they perform the offices of motion, in others of ſenſe. But that ſo many nerves being deſtinated to ſo many ſeveral members, and remote one from another, yet ariſing together, are collected as it were into one bundle, the reaſon is, that in all the parts to which thoſe nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, a certain Sympathy and conſent of actions might be conſerved: to wit, the communion of thoſe nerves is the cauſe why the ſight and ſmell move ſpittle and pleaſe the Palate; nor by any other means are the <hi>Praecordia</hi> affected, according to the various conceptions of the Brain, and tranſmit their affections o he ſeveral parts of the Face; from whence the aſpect or countenance of the whole Animal is pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically figured, as ſhall be ſhewed more particularly below.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, let us deliver a ſhort Hypotype or figure of this Nerve; its trunk going out of the ſides of the greater Ring, ſometimes near its beginning, but oftner the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> being firſt perforated or paſſed through, is divided into two noted branches. The firſt of theſe tending ſtraight downward, going out of the Skull at a proper hole, in its deſcent towards the lower Jaw, (to whoſe parts it is chiefly deſtinated) is divided into more branches, with which it furniſhes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-muſcle, alſo the Muſcles of the Face and Cheeks. Moreover from them ſhoots and branches are diſtributed into the Lips, Gums, roots of the Teeth, Jaws, Throat, the farther end of the Palate, yea and the Tongue; for this reaſon chiefly, that the nerves going out of the lower branch of the fifth pair, might effect, beſides ſenſe, the divers offices of Taſte and Touch or Feeling, and motions of a various kind in the aforeſaid members and parts; moſt of which, as the chewing of the aliment, alſo thoſe which have reſpect to configuration or framing of the mouth and face in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or weeping (as we have already noted) are performed unknown to the Brain, that is involuntarily, and by the help of the Cerebel only, from which theſe Nerves are derived.</p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:107014:99"/>
                     <p>The other ſuperior, and alſo the greater branch of the fifth pair under the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> nigh the ſide of the Turkey Chair goes ſtraight forward for a little ſpace, and is inlarged into ſome ſhoots over againſt the pituitary Glandula to the trunk of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotick Artery or the wonderful Net, (where it is preſent) then it is inoculated into the nerve of the ſixth pair, and from thence ſends back ſometimes one, ſometimes two ſhoots; which being united with another ſhoot, turned back from the nerve of the ſixth pair, conſtitute the root or firſt trunk of the intercoſtal Nerve. Concerning this intercoſtal nerve, which is made of the lower ramification or branching out of the nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair, it ſhall be ſpoken of particularly hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after the branches or ſhoots reflected or bent back for the root of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal nerve, that greater nerve of the fifth pair is divided into two noted branches. The leſſer and uppermoſt of theſe tending towards the globe of the Eye, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again twofold, ſends forth two branches from it ſelf; one of which turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inward ſide of the Bone, containing the ball or angle of the Eye, is divided into two ſhoots. The other of theſe having paſſed through the Bone nigh the mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary Proceſſes, is carried into the noſtrils: the office of this nerve is to keep a Sympathy and conſent of action between the noſtrils and ſome other parts: but the other branch of this diviſion is beſtowed on the Muſcle by which Brutes wink.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair is divided into four or five ſhoots, all which going forward above the Muſcles of the Eye, and in ſome part paſſing through its Glandula's, are almoſt all loſt in the Eye-brows, unleſs that in the paſſage they ſend down two ſmall ſhoots which enter the <hi>Sclerotick</hi> Coat a little below the Tendons of the Mulcles, and reach to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> or the fourth thin Membrane that cloaths the Optick nerve; yea and alſo ſend in the paſſage ſmall ſhoots to the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's of the Eye. It ſeems that theſe nerves of the fifth pair, being diſtributed into the Glandula's of the Eyes and Eye-brows, ſerve chiefly to the involuntary and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick actions of thoſe parts; the chief of which are, the languiſhing and mournful aſpect of the Eyes in weeping, and the unwilling pouring out of tears. For as the lower branching of the fifth pair, to wit, the intercoſtal nerve, provideth in man for the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> it eaſily happens, that from the fad affection of theſe, the Cardiack branches of this nerve being forced and wrinkled into Convulſions, the aforeſaid Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmick branches alſo ſo correſpond, and by wrinkling the Eye-brows, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Glandula's, produce thoſe kind of looks of the Eyes, and marks of ſorrow and grief. Further it is obſerved, that from the Ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair a certain ſhoot is ſent back higher nigh the heads of the Muſoles; which when it has paſſed through at a proper hole, the Bone containing the ball of the Eye, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtraight into the caverns of the Noſtrils. Hence, as I think, a reaſon may be given, wherefore paſſing out of a dark place into the light, at the firſt beholding of the Sun, preſently whether we will or no we ſhall ſneez; to wit, the eyes being too ſtrongly ſtruck by the object, and being ſuddenly and diſorderly moved, that they might turn themſelves aſide, the ſame affection is immediately communicated through the aforeſaid Nerve to the Membrane covering the hollow caverns of the Noſtrils, which being thence contracted and wrinkled, (as it is wont by ſome ſharp thing pulling it) provokes ſneezing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond or greater branch of the ſecond diviſion of the Nerve of the fifth pair being carried nigh the ball of the Eye, is again divided into two branches. The lower of theſe being bent downwards, cleaving into many ſhoots, is beſtowed on the Palate and upper region of the Jaws: The other and higher branch of this ſecond diviſion ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the ball of the Eye, paſſes through, together with the Vein and Artery, a proper hole made in the bone of the upper Jaw; which Veſſels this Nerve climbs and variouſly compaſſes about with many ſhoots ſent forth; then ariſing out of the bone, it imparts little branches to the Muſcles of the Cheeks, Lips, Noſe, and to the roots of the upper Teeth. Therefore foraſmuch as this Nerve embraces and binds about the ſanguiferous Veſſels deſtinated to the Cheeks and the other parts of the Face; from hence a reaſon may be given, why the face is covered with bluſhing by ſhame: for the animal Spirits being diſturbed by the imagination of an unſeemly thing, by and by endeavouring as it were to hide the face, their irregularities enter this Nerve, ſo that the ſhoots of the ſame Nerve embracing the blood carrying Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, by compreſſing and pulling the ſame, cauſe the blood to be more forced into the Cheeks and Face, and the Veins being bound hard to be there for ſome time ſtaid and detained. But foraſmuch as many ſhoots and fibres of the ſame maxillar Nerve, derived
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107014:99"/>from the fifth pair, interweave themſelves with the fleſh and skin of the Lips, hence the reaſon is plain, why theſe parts are ſo very ſenſible, and beſides, why the mutual kiſſes of Lovers, impreſſed on the Lips, ſo eaſily irritate love and luſt by affecting both the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and Genitals; to wit, becauſe the lower branching of the ſame fifth pair actuates theſe parts conſtituted in the middle and lower Belly, and draws them into the like affection with the Lips. The ſame reaſon holds of Love preſently admitted by the eyes, that as the Poet ſays,
<q>
                           <l>Mars videt hanc, viſám<expan>
                                 <am>

                                 </am>

                           <l>As ſoon as <hi>Mars</hi> ſaw her, he deſir'd her.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have but now intimated, that many ſhoots of this Nerve were deſtinated for the buſineſs of chewing; and therefore, becauſe the aliments to be taken ought to undergo not only the examination of the taſte, but alſo of the ſmell and ſight, from the ſame Nerve, whoſe branches being ſent to the Palate and Jaws, perform the buſineſs of chewing, other ſhoots, as it were fore-runners, are carried to the Noſtrils and Eyes, to wit, that theſe Organs of the other Senſes might be furniſhed with ſome helps of probation alſo, for the better knowing or diſtinguiſhing the objects of taſte. Certainly from the nearneſs of kindred and manifold affinity of this Nerve, being alſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the Head, the mutual dependencies and confederations of very many of its parts, proceed. But how this Nerve in other Provinces, to wit, in the <hi>Thorax</hi> and lower belly, and there about the motions and ſenſions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> doth cauſe various Sympathies of them among themſelves and with other parts, ſhall afterwards be more largely ſhewn, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the intercoſtal Nerve, which is rooted in this nerve of the fifth pair; where, from the manifold communication of this nerve, may be eaſily drawn the reaſons of ſneezing, yawning, laughing, crying, and of other actions merely natural. In the mean time, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior branching of the nerve of the fifth pair ſhews it ſelf after this manner in the Head, and almoſt after the ſame manner is divaricated in moſt living Creatures; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept however, that in ſome, preſently after its riſe, it is divided into t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ree great branches; one of which is deſtinated to the lower Jaw, the other to the Eye and Noſe, and the third to the Cheek.</p>
                     <p>The Nerve of the ſixth Conjugation follows, which ariſing out of the loweſt foot of the annular Protuberance, and being hid under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> preſently goes out of the Skull at the ſame hole with the nerves of the third and fourth pair, and is carried with a ſingle trunk into the ball of the Eye; but ſo, that near the ſide of the Turkey Chair it is inoculated with the ſecond branch, or the greater of the fifth pair; from whence it turns back, ſometimes one little branch, ſometimes two; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united with the branches of the fifth pair running back, conſtitute the beginning of the intercoſtal nerve. Then this nerve going forwards, is divided into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches near the ball of the Eye; one of which is inſerted into the Muſcle drawing back the Eye planted in its outward angle; and the other being torn into various fibres, is beſtowed on the ſeventh Muſcle proper to Brutes; ſo that this nerve alſo ſeems to ſerve to thoſe motions of the Eye that are almoſt only pathetick, or excited by natural Inſtinct. For, as to the uſe of the former ſhoot, it plainly appears, that it is innate to every Animal in a ſudden fear to draw the eyes backward, and to look for what is to be feared on either ſide and behind: then as to its other ſhoot, whereby Brutes wink or twinkle the eye, it is obvious that this ſame motion is ſudden and extemporary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous intention, whereby the eye endeavours to ſhun the injuries of outward things that occur.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh Conjugation of Nerves, accounted for the fifth by the Ancients, is imployed about the ſenſe of hearing. Of this pair commonly are noted two Proceſſes, the one ſoft, the other hard; which indeed ſeem to be two diſtinct nerves, for that although they have their beginnings nigh one another, yet are ſomewhat diſtinct, and are carried to divers Organs; in the mean time, either agreeing in a certain common reſpect of uſe or action. For whilſt one nerve perform the act of hearing, the other ſupplies ſome requiſites whereby that act may be the better performed: wherefore we ſhall not much ſtrive againſt the common deſcription of this pair, by which it is taken for one. The proceſs of this pair, or the auditory nerve properly, which is called the ſoft Branch, ſeems to ariſe in man out of the lower ſide of the ringy Protuberance, and in beaſts out of the midſt of the leſſer Ring. In ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections I plainly ſound, that this ſofter nerve, having its beginning lower, ſeemed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107014:100"/>to aſcend a little before it went out of the medullar ſtock; and the other more hard nerve ſeeming to ariſe higher (<hi>viz.</hi> out of the medullar whitiſh line leading about the bottom of the fourth Ventricle) did deſcend a little, and aroſe near the meeting with the other. This ſofter nerve is carried into the paſſage of the ſtony Bone, where entring into the den deſtinated for the receiving the found, which is on this ſide the Snail-like winding and the Drum, it ſo infolds it ſelf into the moſt thin Membrane wherewith that den is covered, that as often as the Air implanted in that cavern is moved by the ſtroke of the external Air made upon the Drum, this impreſſion ſtriking this Membrane, and ſtirring up as it were an undulation of the animal Spirits, is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with carried towards the common Senſory by the paſſage of the nerve there implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There will be a more opportune place of diſcourſing, after what manner, and by what ſort of Organs Hearing is performed, when we ſhall ſpeak of the Senſes.</p>
                     <p>The other Nerve of this pair, or the more hard proceſs, which conduces rather to motion than ſenſe, paſſing through the ſtony Bone at an hole proper to it ſelf, ariſes near the auditory paſſage, where it preſently receives into its trunk a branch from the wandring pair brought thither; then immediately after that joyning together or coalition, it is divided into two branches: The firſt of theſe tending downwards, is beſtowed upon the Muſcles of the Tongue and the Bone <hi>Hyoides;</hi> the other going about the auditory paſſage, and bending more upwards, is divided into three ſhoots; the firſt of which, anſwering to the nerve of the former diviſion, beſtows ſome ſhoots on the Muſcles of the Lips, Mouth, Face, and Noſtrils, and ſo actuates ſome exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Organs for the forming the voice, as the former doth ſome interior Organs. The ſecond ſhoot of this diviſion diſtributes its ſhoots into the Muſcles of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows and Forehead; and the third into the Muſcles of the Ear it ſelf. The offices and uſes of all theſe have been already ſhewn, the ſumm of which is, that as often as the ſound is admitted in, eſpecially if it be any ways unuſual, new, or to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, preſently by a certain natural inſtinct the Ears and Eyes erect and open themſelves: to wit, for that end ſhoots from this nerve are inſerted into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Eye-lids and Ears, that by the paſſage of theſe, the Spirits inhabiting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Region, might be called out as it were to watch. For a like reaſon ſhoots from the ſame hard proceſs of this nerve are diſtributed both into the Muſcles of the Tongue and of the Bone <hi>Hyoides;</hi> as alſo into thoſe of the Lips and the outward parts of the Mouth, that by their paſſage, the ſound being tranſmitted further to theſe Organs of the voice, it being equal or like the ſame, might officiouſly anſwer it as were an <hi>Echo.</hi> That the deſcriptions of the aforeſaid nerves might be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I have thought good here to repreſent in the following Figure the branchings of the fifth and ſixth pair.

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Deſcription of the eighth Pair of Nerves.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Conjugation of the Nerves of the eighth pair, accounted by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients for the ſixth, is called the Wandring pair; to wit, for that its Nerve, not content with one member or region of the Body, is thought to reſpect divers parts, and thoſe different, and ſituate at a great diſtance one from another, and to reach forth its branchings, not only in the neighbourhood about the Head and Neck, but through the whole cavity of the middle and loweſt Belly, and to moſt of the Bowels in either. But indeed this nerve hath a province large enough, yet not ſo diffuſe as is commonly thought: for many other nerves, inoculated into this, joyn themſelves with it, and are accounted a part of it, although they have diſtinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and going away again from the nerve of the eighth pair, have peculiar diva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rications, and different from it. Wherefore, that we may give to each its own, we ſhall endeavour to proſecute this nerve of the wandring pair from the beginning to the end; and alſo ſhew the confederations and coincidences or joynings together of others with it.</p>
                     <p>The eighth Conjugation therefore of the Nerves ariſes below the auditory or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nerves out of the ſides of the oblong Marrow, its root conſiſting of numerous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres. In a man there are at leaſt twelve, ſome of which are greater, others ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to which is added a noted Fibre, or rather Nerve, much greater than the reſt, from the ſpinal Marrow, which being joyned with them, and wrapped about with the ſame Coat, taken from the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> goes forth together out of the Skull, as if they all grew into one Trunk: but that acceſſory nerve, yea and many other Fibres, do ſtill remain diſtinct under that covering, and afterwards departing aſunder, are carried into peculiar provinces.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe this ſpinal Nerve having paſſed the Skull, leaving its Conjugation, is carried to the muſcles of the Neck and Shoulders; beſides, the noted Fibre, out of the beginning of the wandring pair, is preſently carried into the hard proceſs of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Conjugation; and two other Fibres, having preſently left the company of the reſt, go into the muſcles of the Throat and Neck: but the reſt of the Fibres, being collected together, go forward ſtill as Companions, and inſtead of their other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions which departed from them, they preſently get new in their places; to wit, ſometimes the whole trunk of the intercoſtal nerve it ſelf, as is ſeen in moſt four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Beaſts, ſometimes only a branch of it comes to them, as is obſerved in Man and ſome other living Creatures.</p>
                     <p>In this place where the trunk or branch of the intercoſtal Nerve is inoculated into the trunk of the wandring pair, a noted infolding is conſtituted, to wit, the trunk of the nerve being there made greater, ſeems to he liſted up, and to grow out into a certain Tumor like to a callous or ſinewy ſwelled body: here, for that it is ſomewhat long, it is called by <hi>Fallopius</hi> the Olive body; of which ſort the ſame Author affirms, there comes to this nerve ſometimes one, ſometimes two; but in truth, one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly found in the trunk of the wandring pair, but the other in the neighbouring intercoſtal.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe ſort of infoldings in general we ſhall take notice, that they are made in the Nerves, as joynts in a Cane, or knots in the ſtem of a Tree, <hi>viz.</hi> as often as a branch goes out of the trunk, or ſliding into another place, is received into the ſame; and when oftentimes ſome ſhoots go away from the ſame place, and others come to it, the infolding there becomes greater; and ſo the more branches and ſhoots do happen to come together any where, or to go out of a nerve, the greater the bulk and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the infolding is increaſed: but if at any time a branch ſeems to proceed from any nerve without conſtituting an infolding, in truth, being included only in the ſame Coat, it is not accounted ſo much a branch as a companion, which by a paſſage long before, had gone together forwards, as a ſingle nerve it ſelf, and diſtinct enough, nor was it at all inoculated before its departure. But the uſe of theſe ſame infoldings ſeems to be the ſame with the knots in the ſtem of a Tree, or ſuch as the turnings aſide or by-paths that lye near croſs-ways; to wit, that when the animal Spirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107014:102"/>with the nervous Juyce, inſtitute divers journies, leſt mutually meeting, they ſhould be confounded, they may be able to turn aſide a little, and depart one from another till they may recover their orders and juſt method.</p>
                     <p>In the Diſſection of the Nerves, which are diſtributed to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the two Ganglioform infoldings, to wit, the aforeſaid in the trunk of the wandring pair, and the other near growing in the intercoſtal nerve, are as it were two bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones, which being firſt diligently traced, the other threads of the Anatomical task, both on this and that ſide, are eaſily handled. But that theſe infoldings may be ſound, the trunk of the <hi>Carotidick.</hi> Artery is laid open on both ſides between the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Neck; then by following its tract, the aforeſaid Olive bodies come into view about the inſertion of the lower Mandible; out of which, both the upper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and the lower branchings of either nerve, may be deſigned or drawn. But becauſe about this place the nerves begin to be figured otherwiſe in a Man than in Brutes; that the reaſon of the difference may be known, we will here proſecute apart and diſtinctly the <hi>Neurologie</hi> or Doctrine of the Nerves of either; and firſt we ſhall deliver the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the wandring pair, and its confederations with the intercoſtal and other nerves, as they are found in Man.</p>
                     <p>The Ganglioform infolding therefore being conſtituted upon the Trunk of the wandring pair, receives one Nerve ſent into it elſewhere, and ſends forth another from it ſelf. To this is brought a ſhoot from the intercoſtal nerve different from moſt brute beaſts, where the whole trunk of the intercoſtal nerve comes, and ſeems to be united to the wandring pair. But from the aforeſaid infolding, a noted branch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent forth, is carried towards the <hi>Larynx,</hi> which when it is divided into three ſhoots, the firſt of them is ſtretched out into the Sphincter of the Throat; the ſecond being hid under the Scutiform or Shield-like Cartilage, diſtributes its ſhoots to the upper Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and to the Muſcles by which the chink of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is ſhut up; and the third alſo entring the Shield-like Cartilage, meets the top of the returning nerve, and is united to the ſame. Such an inoculating of this nerve, with the returning nerve, is conſtantly found in man and in all other perfect Animals; the reaſon of which is delivered anon.</p>
                     <p>Below the aforeſaid infolding of the wandring pair, its ſtem, near the ſide of the aſcending Caroditick Artery, goes forward ſtraight downwards, and in its journey imparts ſome ſmall ſhoots to the ſame, which ſometimes compaſs about the trunk of its Veſſel, ſometimes are inſerted into its Coats. In the lower part of the Neck this trunk of the wandring pair admits a branch of the intercoſtal nerve from its neighbouring infolding, and in the left ſide about that place ſends forth another nerve from it ſelf into the returning nerve; which croſs branch, being ſtretched out only in the leſt ſide, is found in man and all brute beaſts: but from thence the trunk of the wandring pair deſcends without any noted branchings till it comes over againſt the firſt or ſecond Rib; where another infolding being made, many ſhoots and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous fibres are ſent forth towards the Heart and its Appendix. But this divari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Cardiack nerves is not after the ſame manner altogether in either ſide.</p>
                     <p>For in the left ſide one or two noted ſhoots being ſent forth, together with other ſhoots ariſing from the intercoſtal Nerve, are inferted into the Cardiack infolding; but many fibres going out at the ſame place, are diſtributed to the Veſſels hanging to the Heart, and to its little Ears and <hi>Pericardium.</hi> In the right ſide a noted ſhoot going into the greater <hi>Cardiack</hi> infolding, another into the leſs, and two other ſhoots from the middle infolding of the intercoſtal Trunk towards the Cardiack infolding, aſſociate themſelves and are united. Beſides, numerous Fibres in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the Veſſels of the Heart and the <hi>Pericardium.</hi> Alſo the returning Nerve in this ſide ariſing higher, is turned back about the axillary Artery, when in the left ſide the ſame going away much lower than this infolding, from the Trunk of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair, compaſſes about the deſcending Trunk of the Aorta, and from thence it is turned back upwards.</p>
                     <p>The returning Nerve, although it ſeems a branch ſent forth from the Trunk of the wandring pair, being indeed a diſtinct and ſingular nerve, comes even from the beginning of the wandring pair; yet for better conducts ſake it is contained under the ſame Coat with the reſt of the Trunk of the wandring pair. In either ſide about the knots of reflection or turning back, it ſends forth ſhoots and fibres which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the Veſſels of the Heart. The reflected Nerve in its aſcent receives in the left ſide a branch from the middle infolding of the Intercoſtal, and another from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107014:103"/>the wandring pair; but either running back, diſtributes many ſhoots to the rough Artery; then its extremity meeting with the ſhoot, which is ſent out of the Ganglio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form infolding of the wandring pair, is united to it.</p>
                     <p>A little below the coming away of the returning Nerve on the left ſide from the Trunk of the wandring pair, another noted branch is ſent forth on both ſides; which being carried towards the Heart, covering its Baſis in the hinder Region, meets it on both ſides, and diſperſes in all its proceſs branches through the whole Superficies of the Heart. As ſhoots go from theſe branches into the hinder part of the Heart, ſo many branches and ſhoots go from the Cardiack infoldings which are divaricated into its fore-part.</p>
                     <p>But there are two Infoldings from which the Nerves are diſtributed into the Heart. The upper and greater is between the <hi>Aorta</hi> and the Pneumonick Artery. The nerves conſtituting this are one or two noted branches that deſcend hither from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Trunk of the wandring pair; but chiefly many nerves from either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve, to wit, from the midſt of its infolding. From this infolding two or three noted nerves are carried under the Aorta into the left ſide of the Heart. But from this infolding, a ſhoot being ſent forth, making as it were an handle, compaſſes about the pneumonick Artery; and a branch deſcending from the right Trunk of the wandring pair to the exterior part of this handle, and another, which being carried from the nerve which is deſtinated to the hinder region of the Heart, meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and make the leſſer infolding; from which nerves are ſent into the right ſide of the fore-part of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>We are to take notice, That in brute Animals many more and far greater Nerves are carried from the Trunk of the wandring pair into the Heart and its Appendix than in Man, to wit, in whom the chief Cardiack nerves or belonging to the Heart proceed from the intercoſtal pair, as is ſhewed below; wherefore in Brutes, for that reaſon, the wandring pair affords greater ſupplies or ſubſidies to the Heart, becauſe the intercoſtal nerve ſcarcely contributes any to it. Further, through the whole tract of the wandring pair, from whence the Cardiack nerves proceed, very many ſmall ſhoots, being ſent forth on both ſides, are inſerted into the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> and the Glandula's implanted without the <hi>Pericardium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Region of the Heart, the Trunk of the wandring pair ſends forth many noted ſhoots on both ſides, which being carried into the Lungs, are diſtributed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the blood-carrying Veſſels, through their whole ſubſtance, and in their paſſage ſtep by ſtep they follow the Pipes of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> both the Arteries and the Veins, and many ſhoots being ſent forth on every ſide, the climb upon and compaſs about theſe Veſſels; then the Trunk of the ſame wandring pair, deſcending on both ſides, nigh the ſides of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> diſtributes many ſhoots alſo into the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Below the Pneumonick branches, either Trunk of the wandring pair going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards downwards nigh the ſides of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> is divided into two branches, <hi>viz.</hi> into the exterior or more outward, and the interior or more inward. Both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward branches inclining towards one another mutually, do again grow into the ſame Nerve, which being ſent ſtraight down towards the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and being carried nigh the inward part of its Orifice, is bent back from thence, and creeps through its upper part. From both branches, being carried nigh the oppoſite parts of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Orifice, many ſhoots are produced, which being mutually inoculated, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the nervous infolding like a little net. The Stomachical lower branch ſends forth very many fibres and ſhoots nigh the left part of the bottom of the Ventricle, which are united with others, ſent forth from the Meſenterick and Splenetick infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Further, in the right part of the ſame bottom of the Ventricle, ſhoots being ſent forth from either Stomachical branch, are united with other ſhoots ſent upwards from the Hepatick infolding; and about this place either Trunk of the Nerves of the eighth pair ſeems to be terminated, for that the laſt that may be perceived of it are ſome ſhoots ſent forth from the Stomachical branches, which are inoculated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſed with the little branches or fibres ſent upwards from the Meſenterick infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Actions and Uſes of the Nerves of the eighth Pair, deſcribed in the foregoing Chapter, are unfolded.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter this manner the beginning and branchings out of the Nerves of the eighth pair are diſpoſed in Man: and they are almoſt after the ſame manner in Brutes, unleſs the Cardiack branches be more, becauſe in theſe they go out only from this one Conjugation. The Figure or Type of all theſe is well deſigned or drawn in the ninth Table or Figure. It now remains, recollecting the Tracts of this Deſcription, or at leaſt the things chiefly to be noted, that we inquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or Appearances.</p>
                     <p>This Nerve, preſently after its riſe, appears with numerous Fibres, as may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the ninth Figure <hi>E:</hi> the reaſon of which is, becauſe many nerves here ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together, and deriving plenty of animal Spirits from the ſame ſtock or proviſion, ought to carry the ſame to divers parts, and remote one from another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they aſſume their <hi>Latex</hi> or Juyce, not at one Trunk, as the blood-carrying Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and afterwards diſtribute it equally by branches and ſhoots here and there ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; becauſe the Spirits, derived from the ſame Fountain, have need to flow into theſe parts ſeparate from them, and variouſly to tranſpoſe and change their influence: wherefore for this buſineſs it is required (that we may not ſuppoſe little doors in the middle of the branchings out of the nerves, as are in the Pipes of a muſical Organ) that the nerves, which are deſtinated for the performing of divers offices reſpectively in diſtinct parts, ſhould be ſingle in their whole paſſage, and of themſelves diſtinct chanels of Spirits; for the ſake of a better conduct many of them are collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſeem to grow together into one Trunk; but they are parted both in their beginning, and alſo in their whole journey, and diſtinguiſhed, though involved in the ſame Coat, and ſo are carried to the reſpective parts. Otherwiſe how ſhould it come to paſs, that the Spirits to be carried for the performing the inſtinct of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the Stomach, do not enter at the ſame time the Lungs or <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and actuate them with an inordinate influence? For indeed the ſhoots of the nerves of the wandring pair may be followed by the eyes and hand backwards towards the beginning, from the parts into which they are inſerted, and where they ſeem to be united into the ſame Trunk, ſo ſeparated with the ſinger, that it may appear they are ſingle. After the ſame manner we have plainly ſeparated one from another the returning nerve alſo, and others, their common Coat being diſſected. Yet in the mean time we deny not, that in their progreſs they do communicate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Fibres meeting mutually, if it be granted, that the ſame, although they ariſe together, in their very riſe it ſelf are in a manner diſtinct. For by reaſon of the nearneſs of the beginning and progreſs, though all the nerves of the wandring pair have a certain Sympathy and conſent in their actions; yet for that they conſiſt of parted ſtrings, they perform their actions ſucceſſively, and convey the influences of the Spirits to theſe parts ſeparate from thoſe.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſhewn, that the Nerve of the wandring pair, and others belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its family, do ſerve almoſt only to the involuntary Function. Wherefore it may be thought, that as there are many ſhoots and fibres, which going out diſtinctly from the ſame origine, are carried to divers parts, that indeed thoſe Bowels and Members, into which theſe nerves are inſerted, do perform their particular actions, ſtirred up either by the inſtinct of Nature, or by the force of the Paſſions, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in the mean time ſcarce knowing it: yea alſo, that when certain other nerves, ariſing afar off, are joyned to this Trunk of the wandring pair, and communicate with it near the very origine of it; this ſeems to be therefore done, that thoſe nerves, an affinity with the wandring pair being begun, may be drawn into Sympathy with it, and into an unity of action of the involuntary Function. This appears clearly by the acceſſory nerve from the Back bone, and ſome others, as ſhall be manifeſted anon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, we ſhall obſerve concerning the Fibres of the wandring pair, firſt that a noted ſhoot, inclining towards the vocal proceſs of the ſeventh pair, is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107014:104"/>united with the ſame, as in the ninth Figure <hi>e.</hi> Hence a reaſon may be taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in every violent Paſſion, as of Anger, Fear, Joy, and the like, without the will or intention of the Animal, the Tongue ſends forth a voice, as an index of the excited affection; ſo that not only men, but ſome brute beaſts, in their fleeing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, wail, cry out, and make a noiſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From the beginning of the wandring pair very many Fibres are diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into the Muſcles of the Neck, Figure the ninth <hi>FFF.</hi> in which there ſeems lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need of the ſtirring up of ſpontaneous motions in that part; for to this task the Vertebral nerves ſerve ſufficiently. Notwithſtanding the aforeſaid Fibres of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair are the cauſe why the Neck is moved about in fear, or at any noiſe or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of danger; and alſo, why in ſome Animals, from indignation or pride, the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into which theſe nerves are inſerted, being inflated very much, their necks ſwell up, and the Creſts of many are erected, Of how great uſe the acceſſory nerve, coming from the Spine to the wandring pair, is for the pathetick motions of the Arms, ſhall be ſhewed preſently.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The other Fibres of the wandring pair, being gathered together, ſeem to grow together into the ſame Trunk, which preſently conſtitures the Ganglioform infolding from a ſhoot coming from the intercoſtal nerve, as in Figure the ninth <hi>G.H.</hi> And indeed it is very likely, that of theſe Fibres, which are complicated together in the Trunk of the wandring pair, one is deſtinated to the returning nerve, another to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> a third to the Lungs, and laſtly, another to the Ventricle; all which, although they have communication among themſelves, and for the ſake of a better conduct are gathered together in one, yet they are ſtill diſtinct from their very original, and conſtitute divers paſſages of the animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>But that a ſhoot is carried from the intercoſtal Nerve into the upper infolding of the wandring pair, as in the ninth Figure <hi>h;</hi> the reaſon is, that between theſe nerves a certain ſtrict affinity and kindred might be, and that either of them might be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the others offices. For as the nerve of the wandring pair diſtributes ſhoots chiefly to the <hi>Pracordia,</hi> and the Stomach, and the intercoſtal Nerve to the reſt of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly; we may obſerve, that between all theſe there are not only ſome commerces, but Sympathies, and a conſent of Actions and Paſſions; wherefore there is a neceſſity, that the nerves deſigned to either parts, ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate among themſelves. Further, in Man the intercoſtal nerve imparts to the Heart and its Appendix more ſhoots and fibres than the nerve of the wandring pair: where fore theſe nerves do not only communicate by theſe ſuperiour infoldings, but alſo again a little lower by a ſhoot ſent out from the cervical infolding, or that of the Neck.</p>
                     <p>From the aforeſaid infolding a noted branch of the wandring pair is ſent forth into the Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> a certain branch of which, entring the Shield-like Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage, meets with the returning nerve, and is united to it <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>h.</hi> It will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to collect what the uſe of this nerve may be; for ſeeing the <hi>Larynx</hi> or the rough Artery ſerves both for the drawning in and putting out of the breath, and alſo for the modulating the voice; for either office that its Trunk, like the folds in a pair of Bellows, may become ſometimes more ſhort, ſometimes more at length, theſe ſame ringy Cartilages ought to be pulled together, or contracted ſometimes upward, and ſometimes downward. That a flat voice or ſound might be formed, they ought to be preſt down as much as may be to the bottom; but if you would form a more ſhrill or ſharp ſound or voice, the ſuperiour Rings are lifted up; to wit, that the ſound might be broken but only in the very paſſage of the Jaws. For the performing of this double motion of the <hi>Larynx</hi> two nerves are conſtituted like the hands of a Piper, one of which ſtops the lower holes, the other the upper of the Pipe: to wit, the ſhoots and branches of the returning nerve being lifted up from below, move the ringy Cartilages downwards; and the nerve ſent out from above from this infolding; preſently draws the more ſuperior upwards. Further, becauſe a certain conſent and joynt action is required in both nerves, therefore they are mutually inoculated or ingraffed: yea, whenas either of them returning, diſtributes frequent ſhoots into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the <hi>Trachea;</hi> it ſeems that thoſe that are ſent out into the right part, move its Rings downwards for inſpiration and a ſtrong Voice; and the others, going out on both ſides into the left part, carry the Rings upward for Expiration and for an acute or ſharp Voice. Moreover, as the inſtinct for the motion of depreſſion or preſſing down is delivered from the knots of the recourſe or reflections; ſo the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107014:104"/>for the elation or lifting up of thoſe parts, is received from this nerve of the <hi>Ganglioform</hi> infolding.</p>
                     <p>A noted branch from the middle infolding of the intercoſtal Nerve is carried into the Trunk of the wandring pair, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>i.</hi> For what end that is ſo, we have ſhewn already; to wit, that the commerces of the Spirits dwelling in both nerves, might be ſtrengthened: but it ſhould be noted, that it is only ſo in the left ſide where the Trunk of the wandring pair ſhews it ſelf ſingle for a long ſpace; but in the right ſide, where the returning nerve goes from it much higher, here the other nerve from the intercoſtal infolding is plainly wanting.</p>
                     <p>About the Region of the firſt or ſecond Rib, another noted infolding appears in the Trunk of the wandring pair, from which many ſhoots and fibres are ſent towards the Heart and its Appendix, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>k.</hi> Further, in brute Animals, about this place, the intercoſtal nerve leaves the Trunk of the wandring pair. Without doubt, ſome animal Spirits go apart in this infolding, which are deſtinated to the anterior region of the Heart, alſo to the <hi>Pericardium</hi> and ſome of its Veſſels, whilſt other Spirits paſs through, which a little lower are derived into the hinder region of the Heart; and which being yet carried further, go to the Lungs, and laſtly to the Ventricle.</p>
                     <p>We may obſerve, that from the aforeſaid infolding of the wandring pair numerous ſhoots and fibres are ſent forth, which are diſtributed into the little ears of the Heart and all the ſanguiferous Veſſels belonging to the Heart, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>l. m.</hi> which fibres and nervous ſhoots creeping along like Ivy, thickly cover over the Coats of the Veſſels, and enter them in very many places, and variouſly bind them about. Truly this copious diſtribution of the nerves doth effect the pulſiſick force in the little ears of the Heart and in the Arteries, or at leaſt ſeems to excite it; and ſo to erect and ſtrengthen thoſe parts by a continual influx of the animal Spirits through theſe nerves, that they may be able to ſuſtain an undiſcontinued reciprocation of <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> Moreover, that the thick fibres and ſhoots of the nerves are inſerted both into the Veins and Arteries, and bind both thoſe kind of Veſſels, and variouſly compaſs them about, we may lawfully ſuppoſe, that theſe nerves, as it were Reins put upon theſe blood-carrying Veſſels, do ſometimes dilate, and ſometimes bind them hard toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the determining the motion of the Blood according to the various force of the Paſſions, or to deduce it here and there after a manifold manner; for by this means it comes to paſs, that in fear the excurſion of the blood is hindred, and in other Affections its motion is reſpectively altered.</p>
                     <p>But that many ſhoots and branches are inſerted into the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> it ſeems to be for this uſe; to wit, that that little Cheſt which is made like a Fort for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heart from injuries, as often as any troubleſom matter aſſaults or beſieges it, might be able to draw it ſelf together, and to ſhake off the enemy. For it ſeems, that the inordinate tremblings and ſhakings of the Heart, which are manifeſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from its natural Pulſe, proceed from the violent ſhaking of this Membrane.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cardiack branches ſent from this inſolding we obſerve, that they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſtinated to a publick office, do therefore communicate and enter into the pairs of either ſide before they are inſerted into the Heart; for which end the infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is made before the Baſis of the Heart, where the aforeſaid ſhoots, from the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair and many others, going out from either intercoſtal nerve, meet together. From that infolding, placed between the <hi>Aorta</hi> and the pneumonick-Artery, very many branches being ſent forth above, cover over the Hemiſphere of the Heart: but yet from theſe certain branches, carried under the <hi>Aorta,</hi> are brought into the left ſide of the ſaid Hemiſphere; and as other pairs tend towards the right ſide, one of the firſt of them, making a little handle, binds about the pneumonick Artery; then meeting with other Cardiack ſhoots, makes the leſſer infolding, out of which bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are ſent forth into the right and anterior ſide of the Heart. That from the greater Cardiack infolding, nerves departing one from another, do inſtitute contrary journies towards the Heart, it is indeed, that they might come to divers regions of the Heart without meeting one another, and might affect its Veſſels reſpectively in their paſſage; to wit, the branches carried this way, inſert their ſhoots into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and from the others going that way, one compaſſes about the pneumonick Artery. The reaſon of both ſeems to be, that the blood might be either ſooner or ſlower drawn from the boſoms of the Heart for its various need or neceſſity. For whilſt the aforeſaid nerves do both ſuſtain its motion by their influx, and alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and temper it by their inſtinct, it ſo comes to paſs from thence, that thoſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107014:105"/>Veſſels alſo, being affected by the ſame nerves, do further compoſe themſelves to the requiſite Analogies and proportions of the Pulſes.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there are many Nerves, and thoſe conſpicuous enough, which are inſerted into the Heart, and cover its outward ſubſtance with ſhoots ſent forth from all ſides; yet it is not to be thought, that theſe nerves alone perform and ſuſtain the undiſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued motion of the Heart: becauſe ſo ſmall little ropes ſeem too unequal for the perpetual agitation of ſuch a Machine. Yea it may be obſerved, that more ſhoots and fibres of nerves are diſtributed into the little ears of the Heart and the depending Veſſels, than into its frame or ſubſtance. Further, it is obvious to any that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, that there is a greater plenty of nerves deſtinated to the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Ventricle, or Reins, than to the Heart it ſelf; ſo that ſome Anatomiſts (as <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſays) were doubtful, whether there were any nerves that belonged to the Heart or not. But this being clear enough, that we may deſcribe the motive power of this Clock or Machine ſtirred up by the help of ſome ſmall nerves, as it were an exploſive motion, we ſay that the ſubſtance of the Heart it ſelf conſiſts of a very fibrous fleſh, and may rather be called a Muſcle than <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or congealed ſubſtance: wherefore in this, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Muſcles, the implanted and proper fibres cauſe the local motion and conſtant ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; but by the inſerted nerves is only conveyed the inſtinct of the motion or action; for the performing of which office, both fewer Nerves and fewer animal Spirits flowing in through their paſſages, do ſuffice. But indeed we ſuppoſe, that the animal Spirits implanted in the Heart, and abiding within its Fibres, did at firſt flow thither through the nerves, and that by this way their expences or loſs are made up or ſupplied; yet that the animal Spirits, which ſeem to be diſpenſed to the Heart by ſo ſparing an hand, may ſuffice for the actuating this perpetual motion, they receive continually ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary Forces from the arterious blood. For elſewhere we have ſhewed, that in the Heart, as in the whole muſculous ſtock beſides, a ſulphureous Copula, from the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted blood, is joyned to the ſpirituous ſaline Particles of the implanted Spirits; which matter, whilſt the Spirits are agitated, being at length ſtruck off, and as it were exploded (juſt like the rarified and inkindled Particles of Gun-powder) for the effecting the motive endeavour, do blow up or intumifie the Muſcle or the Heart it ſelf; and ſo from the indiſcontinued action of the Heart much of this ſulphureous Copula, which is eaſily ſupplied from the blood, and leſs of the Spirits, which are brought by the paſſage of the nerves, is beſtowed.</p>
                     <p>And here it may be rightly inquired into, whether the Pulſe of the Heart ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily depends on the influence of the animal Spirits through the Nerves, that it being hindred, the action of the Heart ſhould wholly ceaſe? For the deciſion of this, we once made a tryal of the following Experiment upon a living Dog. The skin about the Throat being cut long-ways, and the Trunk of both the wandring pair being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated apart, we made a very ſtrict Ligature; which being done, the Dog was preſently ſilent, and ſeemed ſtunned, and ſuffered about the Hypochondria convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five motions, with a great trembling of the Heart. But this affection quickly ceaſing, afterwards he lay without any ſtrength or lively aſpect, as if dying, ſlow and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to any motion, and vomiting up any food that was given him: nevertheleſs his life as yet continued, neither was it preſently extinguiſhed after thoſe nerves were wholly cut aſunder; but this Animal lived for many days, and ſo long, till through long faſting, his ſtrength and ſpirits being worn out, he died. The carcaſs being opened, the blood within the Ventricles of the Heart, and the Veſſels on every ſide reaching from thence, to wit, both the Veins and Arteries, being greatly coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, was gathered into clotters; to wit, for this cauſe, becauſe the blood, though for the ſuſtaining of life, it was in ſome meaſure circulated, yet for the moſt part it ſtagnated both in the Heart, and in the Veſſels. The cauſe of which ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I can aſſign to no other thing, than that the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ence of the animal Spirits being hindred, wanted its uſual motions.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be further demanded, from whence the animal Spirits (the paſſage of both the wandring pair being ſhut up) ſhould be ſupplied to the Heart continuing ſtill its motion; I ſay, that this may be done by the returning Nerves, as from the knots of which many Cardiack ſhoots and fibres proceed; and beſides, the end of either nerve meeting with the nerve ſent from the upper infolding, is united. But we ſhewed already, that the animal Spirits may be carried either this way or that way within the paſſages of the nerves; wherefore when the neceſſity of life urges, the proviſion of the Spirits, though leſſer, being ſent from the aforeſaid infolding, is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107014:105"/>received by the tail of the returning nerve, and from thence by a retrograde paſſage it was derived into the Cardiack branches, and at length into the Heart it ſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there lyes open alſo another paſſage, and that perhaps more obvious, through the paſſage of the intercoſtal nerve: by this way in a man, as well as by the paſſage of the wandring pair, the Spirits are conveyed from the Brain to the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> yea alſo in Brutes a branch is carried into the Trunk of the wandring pair from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal infolding; ſo that by this by-path ſome little rills of the animal Spirits (if by chance their influence ſhould be hindred through their wonted chanels) might be carried to the Heart. However that Experiment ſeems to conclude, that the motion of the Heart depends no leſs upon the inflowing of the blood, than upon that of the animal Spirit: the total privation of either takes away life; an Eclipſe of the Spirits wholly takes away from the Heart its motive power; and by the defect of the blood (foraſmuch as the ſulphureous Copula is denied to the Spirit implanted in the Heart) the vigour and elaſtick force of the Heart is ſuppreſt, ſo that the Pulſe being by degrees weakened, life is by little and little extinguiſhed. Without doubt, in the finding out the tenour of the Pulſe, we ought always to mind what the alteration of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and what the fault of the blood may bring to it.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another conſideration concerning the Nerves reaching from the Trunk of the wandring pair to the Heart, to wit, that by their paſſage, not only the ſolemn influence and ſtate of the Spirits, for the equally performing of the vital Function, is conveyed; but alſo the inſtinct of every irregular motion, ſtirred up in the <hi>Praecordia</hi> by the force of the Paſſions, is in ſome meaſure transferred this way. I ſay, as to theſe, we ought to diſcourſe and to ſhew by what means, as often as the impreſſion of any Affection exerciſes the Imagination, or rather the Appetite, preſently the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are diſturbed by the paſſage of the Nerves, and by reaſon of their various Affections the motion of the blood is diverſly altered. But becauſe in a man the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and extraordinary motions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> depend on the intercoſtal Nerve as much as and perhaps more than on the wandring pair; therefore we think good to defer this Speculation till the Theory of that Nerve is propoſed. In the mean time, we will proceed to the other branches of the wandring pair; and what next follows, we will inquire into the offices and uſes of the returning Nerves.</p>
                     <p>The returning Nerve in the left ſide, going away from the wandring pair below the aforeſaid infolding, and ſent towards the <hi>Aorta,</hi> is reflected or turned back about its deſcending Trunk, from whence being carried upwards, it imparts ſhoots to the Muſcles of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and the <hi>Larynx</hi> ſent forth by a long tract from either ſide of the Nerve; then its top or height is united with a ſhoot meeting it out of the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioform infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>n. *** h.</hi> But the returning Nerve on the right ſide is reflected much higher about the axillar Artery, to wit, proceeding from the lower infolding of the wandring pair, and after the ſame manner is beſtowed on the other ſide of the <hi>Trachea, Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>L.</hi> But either returning back about the knots of refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſends forth towards the Heart very many ſhoots and fibres, which are inſerted into its little ears, the appending Veſſels or its Infoldings.</p>
                     <p>What the chief uſe of this Nerve is, we have already ſhewn; to wit, being rolled about on both ſides the Artery, as it were a Windlace, it cauſes the little rings of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or Weaſand to be drawn hither and thither, like the folds of a pair of Bellows, both for breathing and making a ſound. But indeed either Nerve, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it being reflected about the Artery, is carried upward into the part to be moved, doth move downwards the little rings of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or Wind-pipe by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhoots of it; alſo foraſmuch as either is terminated in the Nerve, ſent from the Ganglioform infolding, it carries upwards the folds of the <hi>Trachea</hi> by other ſhoots of it. Hence a reaſon may be given, why the returning Nerves being cut off, every Animal is preſently dumb; to wit, becauſe, unleſs the <hi>Trachea</hi> be moved, the breath being blown out, paſſing without any refraction through its cavity, as it were through a Pipe alike hollow in its whole paſſage, gives no ſound.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe Nerves we ought to inquire, what is the reaſon of the difference, that the knots of reflection are not alike on both ſides; alſo for what end the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack branches proceed from both knots. As to the firſt, that the left returning Nerve, not as its pair, binds about the axillary Artery, ſome reaſon ſeems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the left axillary Artery, ariſing below, is carried as the right, by a bending, and not a ſtraight paſſage, into the Arm; wherefore the little cord of the Nerve, compaſſing about its Trunk, hath no fixed, but a very moveable knot of reflection,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107014:106"/>for that it might eaſily ſlide from its place. But it may rather be ſaid, that it is for other uſes, and thoſe more neceſſary, that theſe Nerves compaſs about thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels after that manner. For when they, as it were Reins or Bridles caſt on the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying Veſſels, by pulling them hither and thither, variouſly determine the courſe of the blood, it ſeems to be required, that one returning Nerve ſhould bind together or conſtringe the axillary Artery, and the other the deſcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta:</hi> for as often as there is need for the blood to flow forwards towards the Head more plentifully, the returning Nerves perform it eaſily, by pulling upwards the aforeſaid Arteries: But the blood, after a ſort, ought to be continually urged into the higher parts, leſt otherwiſe by its weight it ſhould turn too much downwards; wherefore in all Expiration or breathing forth, when the <hi>Trachea,</hi> drawing nearer together its ſolds, is contracted upwards, the blood about to deſcend through the <hi>Aorta,</hi> is ſnatched upwards by one tract of the nervous little cord, and in like manner, the axillary Artery in the right ſide being ſhaken with it, the blood flowing in the whole aſcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> is driven upwards a little ſwifter.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this continual and equal ſnatching up of the blood towards the upper parts, it is ſometimes occaſionally urged towards the Head by a more intenſe and quick motion of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> and alſo by a more full and ſwift courſe. For as often as any Animal grows angry, the voice preſently ſhews ſigns of ſuch an Affection, and oftentimes by chiding, they make it ſharp; as men, when they are angry, chide or brawl, and Dogs bark: Now from ſuch an intenſion of the voice and chiding, as the upper rings of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> a reciprocation being there made, are often ſtruck to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſo the blood alſo (the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

For the ſame reaſon, in Joy and Gladneſs, foraſmuch as the <hi>Trachea</hi> is exerciſed by ſinging or laughing, the blood alſo is poured out more plentifully towards the exterior, and eſpecially the upper parts.</p>
                     <p>And from hence the cauſe is plain, wherefore either returning Nerve ſends forth Cardiack branches from the knot of reflection or turning back; to wit, that in thoſe kind of affections, the notice of which the <hi>Trachea</hi> in ſounds or voices gives by the help of the Nerves, the Heart it ſelf by its means alſo might be affected. For ſo, as often as we wrangle or brawl, the Heart being irritated, preſently inkindles the blood more, and drives it forward more plentifully, as food for thoſe Affections, towards the Brain. Alſo in laughter, great rejoycing, or ſinging, by the paſſage of thoſe Nerves, the Heart being brought into a conſent or Sympathy, or joynt action, preſently explodes or drives out the blood by a ſwifter pulſe, and caſts it haſtily out, which otherwiſe would be heavy and troubleſom by a ſlower motion or ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore thoſe ſort of actions, to wit, laughing and ſinging, are ſaid to alleviate the Heart, becauſe they make the blood more freely and readily to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the boſoms of the Heart, and alſo, by the ſupplying help of the Lungs, to be emptied into the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Below the production of the left returning Nerve another noted Nerve is carried towards the hindermoſt region of the Heart, which being carried with a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs about its Baſis, ſends forth frequent ſhoots, which cover the left ſide of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hemiſphere, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Cardiack branch, deſtinated to the hinder region of the Heart, is produced aparo below the reſt, that it might be carried by it ſelf to its Province without the meeting with or implication of others; the pairs are ingraffed on either ſide, that they might acoompany one another, and be together drawn in the ſame action of the Heart. It appears not plain, whether theſe nerves conſpire with the other Cardiack nerves, ariſing above, reaching forth to the anterior Hemiſphere of the Heart; or whether this pair effect not the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Heart, and the upper its <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, certain ſhoots of the kindred or ſteck of either, being ingraffed with others of another ſtock, communicate one with the other.</p>
                     <p>The Trunk of the wandring pair ſends forth on both ſides very many noted bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the region of the Heart, which are ſpread on every ſide into all the Lobes of the Lungs, the <hi>Branchia</hi> of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> and the Coat of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> hard by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107014:106"/>deſcending, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>s.s.s.</hi> Thoſe which go into the Lungs paſs every where through their whole ſubſtance, following the ramifications of the Veins and Arteries, and the Pipes of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> which chanels of blood and air they variouſly elimb over, and bind about through their whole tract.</p>
                     <p>When that ſo many noted branchings of the Nerves are beſtowed on the Lungs, it is a wonder, that by ſome they ſhould be thought to be inſenſible and immoveable of themſelves. Yea it is doubted by many, whether theſe Bowels do cauſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of themſelves by their own endeavour. For that it is a received Opinion, That this reciprocation of the Lungs doth proceed wholly from the motion of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and doth obey or obſerve its dilatation or conſtriction with a certain neceſſary dependency; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Breaſt being dilated or ſpread open after the manner of a pair of Bellows doth compel the ambient Air into the <hi>Trachea,</hi> which ruſhing into the Lungs, blows up and diſtends them; then the ſame Breaſt ſubſiding or ſinking of it ſelf, that the Lungs being preſſed together with the weight of it, do breath forth the Air before intruded. In truth, however that I might judge, that the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the Breaſt do conduce much to Reſpiration; yet that theſe patts ſhould perform this office alone, and that the Lungs are merely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, I cannot grant. For Reſpiration is chiefly inſtituted for the ſake of the blood and the Heart, and its act is wont to be determined according to the various diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe, and to be altered every minute of an hour almoſt according to the manifold neceſſity of the Pulſe. But indeed the Lungs themſelves are they (and not the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi>) which the blood, boiling out of the Heart, paſſes through, and continually affects according to its temper, and the tenour of the Pulſe: wherefore from hence it may be concluded, That the Lungs themſelves do conceive the firſt inſtincts of their motions, and by the help of the aforeſaid Nerves, do in ſome meaſure exerciſe themſelves, and endeavour the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> and deſign them according to the ſenſe of its proper neceſſity; but when in theſe, Fibres requiſite for local motion are wanting, therefore the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi> help continually the endeavours of the Lungs, and by the cooperation of theſe, compleat breathing is effected. And ſo when Nerves of a twofold kind, to wit, ſome from the Spine being inſerted into the Muſcles of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and others from the wandring pair diſtributed into the Lungs, actuate the Organs of Reſpiration; for that reaſon it comes to paſs, that the act it ſelf of Reſpiration, of it ſelf unforced and involuntary, may be at our pleaſure ſomewhat reſtrained, interrupted, and diverſly altered. The <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praxis</hi> or joynt action of the Nerves of either kind, in the work of Reſpiration, ſhall be ſhewed hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the Nerve of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It yet appears more plain, that the Lungs are oftentimes the chief in the act of Reſpiration, becauſe they being irritated from ſtrange and improportionate objects, preſently conceive irregular and violent motions; as when a vehement Cough is ſtirred up for the excluſion of any troubleſom thing; to which motion the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi> preſently obey. In like manner, in difficult and ſighing breathing, or any other ways unequal, its firſt inſtinct for the moſt part is begun by the Lungs; yet ſometimes when the exterior Organs of Reſpiration are excited into irregular motions, the Lungs alſo are compelled to follow their irregularities; ſo when the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> after a manner begins laughter, the Lungs perform the ſame with a following cackling ſound: ſo all the Organs of Reſpiration intimately conſpire and agree among themſelves, that although one of them do a thing inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, rather than there ſhall be a Schiſm, the reſt do imitate or follow its irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
                     <p>But that the Nerves, following the Arteries and Veins through the whole frame of the Lungs, do variouſly bind about and cloath their Trunks with a thick ſeries of ſhoots, the reaſon ſeems to be, both that the Coats of the Veſſels being gifted with a conſtant influx of animal Spirits, might imitate the motion of the Heart; and by that means, by a continual pulſation of the Arteries and the conſtriction of the Veins, they might eaſily carry the blood in this its more ſhort luſtration through the Lungs; and the rather, that the pneumonick Veſſels, being bound about with ſuch Reins of Nerves, might moderate the courſe of the blood according to the forces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of the Paſſions. For whenas the exterior circulation of the blood depends upon this interior; as the blood is commanded to paſs ſooner or ſlower through the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107014:107"/>Lungs, or to ſtay there and be hindred, the excurſion and return of it alſo from or towards the Heart is wholly performed. In Joy or Anger, becauſe the Lungs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly transfer the blood out of one boſom of the Heart to the other; therefore its ſwifter and more plentiful flowing out into the outward parts, follows. In like manner, in Fear and Sadneſs, for that the Lungs (its Veſſels being ſtrained together) deliver the blood to the Heart by the Veins, and do not then preſently carry it back by the Arteries, the outmoſt region of the Body is deſtitute of its due influx. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe kind of pathetick ſnatches of the blood are in ſome meaſure perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe its Veſſels are bound about in other places in like manner with the Nerves. If at any time Spaſmodick Affections ſhould afflict the pneumonick Nerves from a morbific cauſe, ſo that being twitcht with inordinate motions, they ſhould pull or draw together here and there the Arteries and Veins which they embrace; for that cauſe, the blood either too much flowing out of the Lungs, makes them to flag, and to fall together into themſelves, ſo that drawing to them copiouſly the Air, they do not eaſily render it back again; or, which frequently happens, the blood being detained within the Lungs, and there ſtagnating, ſtuffs them up, and holds them a long while ſtiff, that they cannot inſpire or drawn in the Air. The Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of either kind ordinarily happen in the Hyſterick diſtempers, and in ſome Hypochondracal. Yea ſometimes the <hi>Bronchia</hi> themſelves are pulled together by the like Convulſion of the Nerves, and are hindred in their motion, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take in and ſend forth the Air after its due manner, as may be ſeen in Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fits. The diſtempers of which ſort are oftentimes produced by the fault of the Nerves, without any implanted Dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition of the Lungs. I have ſometimes obſerved ſome Caſes of ſick people, in which, when at one time the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter beſieging the Brain, had induced Lethargick or Vertiginous Symptoms, a little after the ſame matter occupying or poſſeſſing the origines or middle proceſſes of the nerves belonging to the Lungs, has ſuddenly excited a moſt horrid Aſthma without any previous Cough or Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>But that out of the ſame tract of the wandring pair many ſhoots are diſtributed into the Lungs, and alſo many others into the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus;</hi> from hence a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be given, why a troubleſom Cough oftentimes cauſes Vomiting and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Ventricle; why alſo on the other ſide a perturbation of the Ventricle ſo frequently induces a troubleſom endeavour of Coughing. I have known in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chondriacks, that aliments of ill digeſtion, taken into the Stomach, have preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a vain and very pertinacious Cough; in the mean time, that the Lungs were free from any conſumptive diſpoſition. The cauſe of either diſtemper ſeems to be, that when the nerves, diſſeminated in either part, are taken with a Convulſion, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe which are of the other part, are drawn into a conſent of the ſame diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Perhaps from hence it happens, that ſometimes an Aſthma is induced by reaſon of the evil of the Ventricle, and that that diſtemper (as <hi>Riverius</hi> obſerves) is often wont to be cured by an emetick Medicine.</p>
                     <p>After ſo many branches and ſhoots have been ſent from both ſides the wandring pair, at length its Trunk is divided below the Lungs into two branches, <hi>viz.</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior and interior; either of which inclining towards the pair of branches on the other ſide, are united to them, and after a mutual communication they conſtitute the two Stomachical branches, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuperior and the inferior, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>t. u. w. x.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is worth obſerving, with what wonderful artifice either Trunk of the wandring pair do communicate one with the other with two branches, as it were two hands meeting one the other, that the influence of either nerve might equally reach to every region and part of the Stomach. For whenas either Stomachical branch, to wit, both the upper and the lower, is carried together from the two branches coming out from either ſide of the wandring pair; it is provided, that the Tributes of the Spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to the Ventricle, ſhould be at once certain and very plentiful. For what appertains to the performing the action of this Bowel or Chylification, the Spirits flowing in from either ſide, are abundantly diſtributed into the Orifice, and from thence into all its parts and private places; and by that means it comes to paſs, that the Stomach diſſolves bodies beyond the force of any Chymical Menſtruum. Then beſides, as to the feeling or ſenſe of the Ventricle, or the affection of it from things ingeſted; it is carried alſo towards the Head by a double way (whereby the paſſage may be the more certain) to wit, by either Trunk of the wandring pair; that for that reaſon being indued with a moſt exquiſite ſenſe, it might not be deceived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107014:107"/>its objects; and if that any thing inimical or contrary to it, ſhould lye hid among what is eaten, it might diſcern it and thruſt it out of its own accord, or at leaſt by the knowledge only of the Cerebel.</p>
                     <p>That from the ſame double Trunk of the wandring pair, from whence the Cardiack Nerves ariſe a little above, the Stomachical branches alſo proceed, the cauſe is plain wherefore the Heart it ſelf hath ſuch a Sympathy with the Stomach, ſo that its <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium</hi> or Swooning follows upon any great pulling or hawling of this.</p>
                     <p>Either Nerve of the wandring pair is terminated in the Ventricle it ſelf: for after the eighth Conjugation hath made as it were an high road for the paſſage of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and to this noble Bowel, it puts a bound to it ſelf; nor indeed does it ſeem meet to have its branches ſtretched out any further to the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly: becauſe it ſeems an unworthy thing, that the ſame path which leads to the chief office of nutrition and to the Palaces of life it ſelf, ſhould lye open to the more vile Inteſtines alſo, and the ſink of the whole body. And truly, although the ample path and broad way of the wandring pair is not produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ventricle, yet becauſe a frequent commerce happens between this and the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the other inferior parts; therefore between the Stomach and the other Bowels, though of a more baſe uſe, certain Fibres, as it were ſmaller paths, are reached forth, in which, at leaſt little bands of Spirits, like Diſcoverers or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, run to and fro.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter the unfolding of the Nerve reaching forth to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, we are led by the ſeries or order of the inward parts to the deſcribing a Nerve akin to this, and which reaches forth its branches to the furthermoſt Province, to wit, to all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or Inwards of the lower Belly contained below the Ventricle. This is commonly called the Intercoſtal, becauſe that going near the roots of the Ribs, it receives in every one of their Interſtices a branch from the ſpinal Marrow. Its beginning is not yet ſufficiently detected; for by moſt Anatomiſts it is wrongfully taken for a branch of the wandring pair, though indeed the wandring and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal pair do communicate among themſelves by branches ſent forth one to the other; yet as to both their beginnings, Trunks and wandrings up and down, they are plainly diſtinguiſhed. If that this latter Conjugation, being denied the title of a peculiar nerve, ought to confeſs it ſelf of another ſtock, certainly it owes nothing to the wandring pair, but ſhould borrow its original from the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pairs; for two or three ſhoots being ſent back from thoſe nerves going out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eyes and Face, go into the ſame ſtock or Trunk, which is the Trunk of the intercoſtal nerve, as we have intimated before.</p>
                     <p>The intercoſtal Nerve being conſtituted after that manner, and going out of the Skull at a proper hole, preſently contains the Ganglioſorm infolding, near to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like infolding of the wandring pair; into which two nervous Proceſſes are carried from the laſt pair within the Skull, or the firſt Vertebral. From that infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſhoot is ſent forth into the Sphincter of the Throat, and another noted one into the Ganglioform infolding of the wandring pair. Then this nerve deſcending towards the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> hath in the middle of the Neck another far greater infolding, into which an ample nerve, from the neighbouring Vertebral pair, is inſerted; but from the ſame many nerves, which reſpect the <hi>Pracordia,</hi> are diſtributed on every ſide: For two or three ſhoots are ſent forth into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and one ſhoot into the returning nerve; beſides, numerous fibres and ſhoots are carried both into the returning nerve, and towards the <hi>Trachea,</hi> which are inſerted into its Coats, and into thoſe of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and into the blood-carrying Veſſels. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one branch deſcends into the Trunk of the wandring pair, and two noted nerves into the Cardiack infolding; then a little lower another nerve by it ſelf, proceeding out of the intercoſtal Trunk, is inſerted alſo into the Cardiack infolding: which noted branches ſent down on both ſides from the intercoſtal nerve, for that they joyn

                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:107014:109"/>together with others derived from either Trunk of the wandring pair, make the Cardiack infolding it ſelf. But theſe Cardiack branches from the intercoſtal nerve, as alſo the Cervical infolding, or that in the hinder part of the Neck, whence they proceed, are peculiar to men, and are wholly wanting in brute beaſts.</p>
                     <p>The intercoſtal Trunk deſcends from the cervical infolding towards the chanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, where being about to enter the cavity of the Breaſt, it falls upon the axillary Artery, as it were in right Angles, and ſtrains or binds it; from whence it is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or hidden in the <hi>Thorax</hi> near the roots of the firſt and ſecond Ribs; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving three or four branches from the Vertebral nerves next to thoſe uppermoſt, conſtitutes another infolding, which is commonly called the Intercoſtal infolding. The uppermoſt of theſe Vertebral nerves coming to this infolding in its journey binds the Vertebral Artery, and almoſt compaſſes it about. In Brutes by this nerve which comes upon the Vertebral Artery, the intercoſtal infolding communicates with the root of the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and not by any other means, unleſs by ſmall fibres ſent forth from the lower part of the infolding into the Vertebral nerves. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Brutes a noted branch is carried from this infolding into the Trunk of the wandring pair. But in Man the intercoſtal Trunk paſſes through the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> without any communication had with the other parts; unleſs that from hence in its whole deſcent, running near the roots of the Ribs, it admits in every one of their interſpaces, and from thence even to the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> from between the knots of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> a Vertebral branch.</p>
                     <p>The intercoſtal pair ſends forth a noted branch on either ſide, where having gone through the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt, it comes over againſt the bottom of the Ventricle, which tending towards the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> conſtitutes the chief infoldings of it. But there are ſeven Meſenterick infoldings, <hi>viz.</hi> five great ſuperior, and two leſs inferior: out of all which, numerous ſhoots and fibres are ſent forth together into the parts which they reſpect, and into the neighbouring infoldings. The Meſenterick nerves, which are carried into theſe infoldings, and the infoldings themſelves, and alſo the fibres and ſhoots, which flow out from them on every ſide, like rays of light, are diſpoſed according to the following manner both in Man and in the more perfect Brutes.</p>
                     <p>The Meſenterick branch therefore in the left ſide going from the intercoſtal Nerve, and bending downwards, is parted into two noted ſhoots: the greater of theſe bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back upwards towards the Stomach, diffuſeth it ſelf preſently into an infolding, as a narrow rivulet into a ſpacious Pool. From this infolding numerous fibres and ſhoots go forth as it were in four bands. The firſt of theſe, and which is the greateſt bundle of its fibres, being carried into the Ventricle, is beſtowed partly in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it, and partly theſe fibres are met, and ingraffed with others ſent from the-Stomachical branch. The other maniple or band of nervous Fibres goes forth from this infolding to the Spleen, where the nerves accompanying the ſanguiferous Veſſels, and variouſly binding them about, are diſperſed into the more inward frame or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spleen; yet out of which going towards the Spleen, ſome ſhoots follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhort Veſſels, are carried into the Stomach. The third Company of nervous Fibres is inſerted between this infolding and the Hepatick or that belonging to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, placed in the right ſide over againſt it. Laſtly, the fourth Conjugation of Fibres knits together this and the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery lying under it.</p>
                     <p>The lower ſhoot of the Meſenterick branch, which is on the left ſide, increaſes into an infolding, to which the next Vertebral branch, deſtinated to the intercoſtal Nerve, is carried. From this infolding the chief bundle of nervous Fibres is carried into the left Kidney, and before the Fibres enter the Reins, they bind and variouſly compaſs about the emulgent Veſſels. Further, between this infolding and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Meſentery many Fibres are ſtretched out; from hence alſo many ſhoots are diſtributed into the atrabilary Cheſt, or the Receptacle of the Spleens excrements.</p>
                     <p>In the right ſide the Meſenterick branch being ſent from the intercoſtal Trunk, and being in like manner twofold, contains in its upper ſhoot the Hepatick infolding; out of which the greateſt bundle of nervous Fibres is carried towards the Liver; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſhoots of which accompanying the blood-carrying Veſſels, greatly beſet, and as it were cloath with a little net the Trunk of the Hepatick Artery: which fibres and ſhoots, being carried higher, are diſtributed into the Liver, the Gall-cheſt or bag, the paſſage of the Gall, the Pylorus, and the Pancreas. Further, many Fibres, which are of this Conjugation, meet with Fibres ſent from either Stomachical nerve, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107014:109"/>are ingraffed into them. Another handful of nervous Fibres is ſtretched out between this infolding and the oppoſite infolding belonging to the Spleen, and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery; yea, there is ſome communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had between this and that belonging to the Kidney lying under the ſame ſide by a large ſhoot ſent down.</p>
                     <p>The lower ſhoot of the right Meſenterick branch, like as it is in the oppoſite ſide, contains a ſufficiently noted infolding nigh the atrabilary Cheſt; to which preſently the intercoſtal Nerve imparts its Vertebral branch received below. From this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding the chief bundle of nervous Fibres deſtinated to the Reins, embraces the blood-carrying Veſſels in like manner as in the oppoſite ſide; alſo many fibres and ſhoots are ſtretched out from this infolding to thoſe near, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hepatick and the greateſt of the Meſentery; yea, certain Fibres are diſperſed from the ſame into the atrabilary Cheſt.</p>
                     <p>After this manner either Meſenterick branch being carried from the Intercoſtal pair, and being preſently twofold, immediately conſtitutes two infoldings in either ſide. In the midſt of theſe the greateſt infolding of all ſtands like the Sun in the midſt of the Planets; from which numerous ſhoots and fibres are diſperſed into all the parts of the Meſentery; which indeed following the blood-carrying Veſſels in their whole proceſs, climb over and bind about the ſame. Moreover, between this infolding and every one of the four aforeſaid is produced a peculiar little bundle of Fibres. Beſides, in the female Sex, from hence ſome ſhoots are carried into the Glandula's of the Womb, commonly called the Stones. But from the Meſenterick branches, which conſtitute the former infoldings, no noted branches, but only little ſhoots, are ſent into this infolding. Yea the chief Nerve which is inſerted to this, and ſeems to be the primary for the conveying of plenty of Spirits into it, and a broad way, is carried from a certain ſmall infolding far lower nigh the ſtraight Inteſtine; which infolding, together with the other neighbouring one, that we call the leſſer infoldings of the Meſentery, ſhall be deſcribed preſently. In the mean time, that we may proceed to them in order, we will follow the paſſage of the intercoſtal Nerve.</p>
                     <p>Below the Meſenterick branches, from which the aforeſaid ſuperior infoldings are conſtituted, the intercoſtal Trunk deſcends between the Muſcles of the Loyns, and beſtows every Vertebral branch, admitted in its deſcent, upon ſome internal parts.</p>
                     <p>For the Vertebral branch brought to the intercoſtal Trunk nigh both Kidneys, is carried into the Womens Teſticles, then ſome following into the Ureters. From the Region of the twenty ſeventh <hi>Vertebra</hi> one Vertebral branch and two others, going from the intercoſtal Trunk, tend towards the ſtraight Inteſtine, and there they meet with three pairs ſent from the other ſide; all which being united, conſtitute the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, which is the loweſt of the Abdomen. From this infolding a noted Nerve, being carried upwards, is brought into the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, which in its journey receives one and then another ſhoot ſent down on both ſides from the intercoſtal Nerve; and there, near its bounds, diſtributes ſome ſhoots into the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>But from the loweſt aforeſaid Infolding, a Nerve going towards the upper Infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, about the ſpace of an inch, conſtitutes another leſſer infolding in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; out of which one Nerve tends upwards, and another oppoſite ſtraight down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The former of theſe is carried into the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, and in its whole paſſage ſtretches under the ſtraight Inteſtine, and part of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and inſerts into them many ſmall ſhoots. But the other Nerve deſcending from this infolding towards the <hi>Anus</hi> under the inferior part of the ſtraight Inteſtine, imparts to it alſo frequent ſhoots; ſo that this infolding, the leaſt of all thoſe which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Abdomen, ſeems to be conſtituted for the ſake of this Nerve only, to wit, which lying under the ſtraight Inteſtine and part of the <hi>Colon,</hi> is inſerted into the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery.</p>
                     <p>From the loweſt neighbouring Infolding, to which this leaſt owes its original, two Nerves going out, and being ſent down into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> cauſe there two infoldings, <hi>viz.</hi> one in either ſide, in which the Nerves coming from the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> and ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with the former, meet; from which alſo the Nerves diſtributed into the adjacent parts, ſerve unto the ſeveral Excretions, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Urine, Dung, and Seed made in that place: for two Nerves enter into the end of the ſtraight Inteſtine, and as many into the Womb or Proſtates; but one, and that a noted one, is carried into the Bladder.</p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:107014:110"/>
                     <p>But that we may return to the Intercoſtal pair, after either Trunk of it had ſent forth three branches, out of which the aforeſaid lower infoldings of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> are mediately or immediately made, it deſcends ſtraight towards the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> and in its journey ſends forth yet one or two branches into the Ureters: but as ſoon as it is come to the beginning of the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> both nerves mutually inclining themſelves to one another, are demerged within the bending of the ſame bone, and there nigh its declining, and then in its deſcent, they ſeem to be knit together upon it by two or three proceſſes; and ſo at length either nerve ends in very ſmall fibres, which are diſtributed into the Sphincter of the <hi>Anus.</hi> But ſometimes either nerve joyn together into a round infolding nigh one tranſverſe proceſs, out of which ſingle infolding the like very ſmall Fibres are produced. Further, many others from the laſt Vertebral Nerve meet with, and are ingraſſed with theſe Fibres from the intercoſtal pair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the <hi>Anus.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE beginning of the Intercoſtal Nerve are two or three ſhoots reflected or turned back from the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair, and united into the ſame Trunk, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>D. a. a. b.</hi> Here we may wonder at the birth of this Nerve, as it were borrowed; for it grows as a ſhrub upon another tree or ſhrub; and therefore diſpenſes the common virtues and influences of either with a double branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> both its own and that of its parent: by which ramification or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it comes to paſs, that there are very quick commerces and conſent between the conceptions of the Brain and the affections of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> alſo between the Actions and Paſſions almoſt of all the parts of the whole Body, which belong to the involuntary Function. For in that the Trunk of the intercoſtal Nerve proceeds from the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair nigh their beginnings, that is a ſign that both the influence of the animal Spirits, and the inſtincts for the performing of motions, are derived chiefly into it from the Cerebel; to wit, from whoſe annular proceſs the aforeſaid pairs of Nerves ariſe. But foraſmuch as the ſame intercoſtal Nerve is rooted in their Trunks, and not immediately in the Cerebel; this is the reaſon why the Eyes, as alſo the parts of the Mouth and Face, to which the fifth and ſixth pairs have regard, do anſwer ſo readily and unknown to the Cerebel, as it were by the ſame act, to the motions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> which the intercoſtal Nerve effects; and on the contrary, the motions of theſe preſently follow the action of thoſe. As for example, in Sneezing as ſoon as the nervous Fibres beſmearing the Noſtrils, are wrinkled together by the pulling, preſently by the paſſage of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve the Diaphragma, by reaſon of a more deep inſpiration or drawing in the breath, is for ſome time depreſſed; then the Cramp of the Noſtrils remitting, the Midriff alſo being violently drawn back, cauſes a more ſtrong breathing forth with a vehement blowing of the Air. In like manner on the contrary, when by a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling made upon the Ribs, the Diaphragma being affected with a Spaſm, moves to a cackling noiſe, the Face and Mouth are pathetically figured with it into laughter.</p>
                     <p>The intercoſtal Nerve being ſlid out of the Skull, preſently conſtitutes the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioform infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>G.</hi> it being after the ſame manner in the Trunk of the wandring pair. What the uſe of theſe infoldings is in general, we have already ſhewn; and clearly for the ſame reaſon in this place in the intercoſtal Trunk, where it receives into it ſelf ſome nerves from elſewhere, and ſends forth others from it ſelf into the neighbouring parts, this infolding, as it were a knot in the ſtem of a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Tree, is made, that it may be as it were a diverting place for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold tendency of the Spirits. As to the adventitious Nerves it is obſerved, That by them plenty of ſubſidiary Spirits are tranſmitted hither, only from the ſpinal Marrow, but by a manifold and frequent paſſage; wherefore in this infolding, and again in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107014:110"/>the following, then a little lower, nigh the ſeveral junctures of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebral branch comes to either Trunk of the intercoſtal pair: this ſeems to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for many uſes. Firſt, That the intercoſtal Nerve, by the reiterated faſtening to the ſolid parts, as it were by a frequent ſtay, might become the more firm for the making of a long journey, when otherwiſe its little rope, by too much ſtretching out, might be eaſily broken. Secondly, By this means it comes to paſs, that the nerves which are the Executors of the ſpontaneous, and thoſe of the involuntary Function, might have both a more certain commerce together, and might be ſometimes excited into mutual ſuccors. Hence Reſpiration and ſome other Acts, eſpecially what concerns the Act of <hi>Venus,</hi> participate of either Regiment, ſo that ſometimes they follow the will, and ſometimes draw it even by force or unwilling. Further, when at any time the ſtock of animal Spirits is deficient in either Province, ſupplies of them are ſought from the other: to wit, (as we hinted above) if the influence towards the <hi>Praecordia</hi> be ſhut up through the ordinary paſſages, <hi>viz.</hi> the internal nerves, their paſſages requiſite for the ſuſtaining of life, might be ſupplied by the Vertebral branches: yea it is probable in the partial <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> and in the <hi>Incubus</hi> or Night mare, when the Cerebel being affected, the Spirits deſtinated for the Heart, ſuffer an Eclipſe in the Fountain it ſelf, that through theſe Emiſſaries, to wit, the Vertebral branches inſerted into the intercoſtal pair, ſome extemporary Subſidies are carried for the actuating the Heart. Thirdly, The Vertebral branches by ſo frequent an inſertion, are added to the intercoſtal nerve, perchance in ſome reſpect for this end alſo, that the ſuperfluous or excrementitious humidities, heaped together about the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, might be ſent away by theſe Proceſſes: for indeed we have already ſhewn, that a certain humor doth abound within the Head, the medullar Appendix, and nervous Syſtem; which oftentimes (when it becomes watry, or abounds above meaſure) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a ſerous heap in thoſe parts: wherefore when the branches of the intercoſtal nerve are terminated into the Meſentery, Kidneys, Inteſtines, and ſome Genital parts, it is probable they do transfer into theſe ſinks ſuperfluous humidities, not only their own, but alſo of another ſort, to wit, thoſe received from the ſpinal Nerves.</p>
                     <p>As to the Nerves, which as Emiſſaries, are carried from the aforeſaid Ganglioform infolding into other parts, we obſerve; firſt, that a noted ſhoot is carried from hence into the Sphincter of the Throat, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. This nerve in the Sphincter of the Throat correſponds with others akin, ariſing higher from the fifth pair, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the parts of the Palate and Mouth, and is helpful to them in the buſineſs of chewing: for when the maxillar branches of the fifth pair ſhould perform their work for the chewing of the food taken in, the task of this nerve mediately ariſing alſo from the fifth pair, follows, to wit, whereby the Throat being opened, the chewed meats may be thruſt forward into its paſſage.</p>
                     <p>Another ſhoot is ſtretched out from this infolding into a like infolding of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair placed near, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>a.</hi> The reaſon of this inſertion is delivered above, where we treat of the wandring Pair. But it may be obſerved further concerning this; when ſo nigh a communication happens between theſe infoldings, and when ſhoots are ſent from one of them into the Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and from another into the Muſcles of the Throat, from hence we may give a reaſon, why in Hyſterick diſtempers and in ſome Hypochondriacal there is ſo frequent and familiar a Symptom of the ſenſe of choaking in the Throat. For a Cramp or Convulſion being begun in any nerve, it is wont to creep forward further by the paſſage of the ſame, and ſo to invade ſometimes theſe parts, ſometimes thoſe ſucceſſively. If therefore at any time a Spaſm ariſes any where in any nerve of the wandring or intercoſtal pair, and from thence tending upwards or downwards, ſhall come to either infolding, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently both being affected, and the Muſcles of the whole neighbourhood being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, a bulk or Tumor like a Globe or round thing in the Throat is excited with a ſenſe of choaking.</p>
                     <p>The intercoſtal Nerve deſcending a little lower, contains in the neck another greater infolding proper to man, to which a noted Vertebral nerve is inſerted alſo, out of which many nerves deſtinated to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are ſent forth on either ſide, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>T.</hi> As to the principal parts, to wit, the Brain and Heart, there is no ſuch great difference between a Man and a Brute, as there is about the paſſage of one to the other, or the commerce that thoſe parts have mutually among themſelves. In either kind, for the exerciſe of the vital Function, the animal Spirits are derived
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107014:111"/>from the Head, with a conſtant emanation into the Heart; to which ſort of influence of theirs the paſſage of the wandring pair of nerves ſeems ſufficient: wherefore in moſt Brutes the paſſage to the Heart and its Appendix lyes open only by this way, and ſcarce at all by any nerves of the intercoſtal pair. But in Man the intercoſtal nerve, beſides its offices in the lower Belly, common to him with other Animals, ſerves in the place of a ſpecial Internuncius alſo before the Cloiſter of the Breaſt, which bears the mutual ſenſes of the Brain and Heart this way and that way, or to and fro. For when, beſides the nerves of the wandring pair, ſtretched out alſo into the humane <hi>Praecordia,</hi> (which certainly ſeem ſufficient for the executing of the offices of the Function merely vital) ſo many noted branches are ſent forth from the aforeſaid intercoſtal infolding, what kind of office ſhould be attributed to theſe, unleſs that they ſhould contain the animal Spirits, by whoſe work and miniſtry the mutual reſpects and affections of the Brain and Heart ſhould be communicated to one another? Whilſt I conſider this difference of either kind, it comes into my mind, that Brutes are like Machines framed with a more ſimple furniture and with leſs workmanſhip, and therefore furniſhed with a motion of one kind only, or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the doing ſtill the ſame thing. But in Man divers ſeries of motions, and as it were complications of wheels within wheels, appear. For indeed, by the paſſage of the aforeſaid infolding, the conceptions of the Brain preſently affect the Heart and its Veſſels, and cauſe the reſt of the Appendix, together with the Diaphragma, to be moved. Hence the motion of the blood and its inkindling in the Heart, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Pulſe and Reſpiration, are altered: and for that cauſe, from the Heart being altered, not only impreſſions are retorted upon the Brain by the paſſage of the ſame nerves, but alſo the blood it ſelf, its courſe being changed, drives to the Brain with a different or unaccuſtomed fluctuation, and ſo by moving the animal Spirits with various impulſes, cauſes firſt one ſort of conceptions, and then others to be produced: and ſo by reaſon of theſe reciprocal affections of the Heart and Brain, which are wont by a long ſeries to be propagated viciſſively, a multiplicity of thoughts and Phantaſms ariſes. Hence both the ancient Divines and Philoſophers placed wiſdom in the Heart. Certainly the Works of Prudence and Vertue depend very much on the mutual commerce which happens to the Heart with the Brain: becauſe, that cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about the acts of the Appetite or Judgment may be rightly deſcribed, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful for the hood of the blood to be reſtrained in the Breaſt, and the inordinations of it and of the Heart it ſelf to be governed by the Nerves, as it were by Reins, and to be compoſed into requiſite and apt motions. We might ſay more concerning this, but that this Speculation is from our purpoſe, and belongs more properly to Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or the Doctrine of the Paſſions of the Soul. In the mean time, we may refer hither one or two Obſervations taken from <hi>Anatomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When of late we had diſſected the Carcaſs of a man that was a Fool from his birth, we could find no defect or fault in the Brain, unleſs that its ſubſtance or bulk was very ſmall. But the chief note of difference which we obſerved between the parts of this man and of a man of judgment, was this, That the aforeſaid infolding of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Nerve, which we call the <hi>Internuncius</hi> of the Brain and Heart, proper to man, was very ſmall in this Fool, and beſet with a weaker guard of Nerves.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we were writing theſe, we made an Anatomy of a Monkey, whoſe Brain differed little from that which is ſeen in a Dog or a Fox, unleſs that it was much more capacious in the proportion to the bulk of his Body, and the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it were larger. The orbicular Prominences called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> alſo the ringy Protuberance, ſent down from the Cerebel, came nearer the figure and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of thoſe parts in a man. But what occurred chiefly worthy noting, was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the intercoſtal Nerve, although even as it is wont to be in other Brutes, being included in the ſame ſheath with the Trunk of the eighth pair, was carried through the Neck, yet departing from this Nerve near the Chanel bone, before it was inſerted into the infolding, placed nigh the roots of the upper Ribs, did ſend forth ſome ſhoots into the Heart and its Appendix, and certain Fibres into the nerve of the Diaphragma: which perhaps partly is the reaſon, why this Animal is ſo craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mimical above other Beaſts, and can ſo aptly ſhew and imitate, not only the geſtures, but the paſſions and ſome manners of a Man. But we will proceed to the explication of the intercoſtal Nerve from whence we have digreſſed.</p>
                     <p>We have already intimated for what uſe the Vertebral branch is inſerted into its cervical infolding. There is the ſame reaſon for this as for the other Vertebrals,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107014:111"/>which communicate with the intercoſtal Nerve almoſt in its whole paſſage. But for that the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is radicated in the ſame Vertebral nerve, from whence a branch comes into this infolding, I ſay from that a reaſon may be taken, why the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> intimately conſpires with the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> yea and with the conceptions of the Brain: which kind of Sympathy of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> with the other parts, becauſe it is requiſite to be more ſtrict and noted in man, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That not only the Vertebral branch cometh between the infolding and the root of the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> but two and ſometimes three nerves are ſent from this infolding into the trunk it ſelf of the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma, Fig.</hi> 9 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Truly from hence not only the joynt action or <hi>Sympraxis</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> with the <hi>Praecordia</hi> may be derived; but alſo the genuine cauſe is here manifeſt, why Riſibility is a proper Affection of a man. For as often as the Imagination is affected by any pleaſant or wonderful conception, preſently the Heart deſires to rejoyce, and as it were by ſhaking off its load to be eaſed: wherefore that the blood might be more ſwiftly emptied out of its right boſom into the Lungs, and conſequently out of the left into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> inſtigated by the paſſage of the nerves going out of this infolding, is drawn upward by a more rapid <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and raiſes up the Lungs, as it were making iterated leaps, and cauſes them, by their more frequent ſtriking together, to drive out both the Air and the blood. Then foraſmuch a; the ſame intercoſtal Nerve, which communicates lower with the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> is continued alſo higher with the maxillary Nerves, a cackling being made in the Breaſt, with it the geſture of the Mouth and Face pathetically anſwers.</p>
                     <p>One or two noted ſhoots and many nervous Fibres are carried from this infolding into the returning Nerve, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. ζ. Certainly the reaſon of this communication ſeems to be, that the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Heart it ſelf (into which nerves are ſent from this infolding) might yet more conſpire with the rough Artery (which the returning nerve affects) in its various actions, and eſpecially in laughing, weeping, and ſinging. Moreover, when the returning Nerves, by pulling upwards the Trunks of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> cauſe the blood, for the ſtirring up ſome Affections, to creep more ſwiftly towards the Head, they may in the performing that office be much helped by the aſſociate labour of the Nerves ſent from this infolding.</p>
                     <p>From this infolding in the Neck many ſmall fibres and ſhoots are ſpread into the ſanguiferous Veſſels, as alſo into the Coats of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and the <hi>Oeſophagus, Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>ibid.</hi> As to what belongs to the former that reſpect the <hi>Trachea</hi> and the blood-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Veſſels; their office is, that they may reſpectively draw together and ſpread abroad thoſe chanels of inſpired and exſpired blood and Air, according to the way and manner wherewith the Pulſe and Breathing ought to be performed; whereby the motions of either might be the better retarded or accelerated, according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities or requirings of the Heart. Then numerous Fibres are ſtretched out from this infolding into the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> placed near, that by this means the admirable conſent between the Heart and the Stomach, by reaſon of the Nerves being reached forth from this infolding and from the wandring pair to both, may be produced.</p>

And indeed when the blood, tending upwards and downwards, is wont ſometimes to flow too much towards either bound, ſometimes to be wanting; therefore the nerves, as it were an incitement or remora, are variouſly diſpoſed both in the upper and lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Circuit about the ſanguiferous Veſſels. After what manner this Thora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical infolding is in brute Beaſts, ſhall be particularly ſhewn hereaſter. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Nerve in a Man, both in this infolding and in the whole deſcent through the <hi>Thorax,</hi> receives many Vertebral nerves, as if ſparing of its own ſtock, and greedy of anothers, but ſends forth from it ſelf not a ſhoot: whatever of Spirits is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either from the influence above, or comes to it by the by, is reſerved wholly for a largeſs to be beſtowed on the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly. But after what manner, and by what paſſages of nerves that is diſpenſed into the ſeveral parts, we will unfold in the following Chapter.</p>

Of the infoldings which are on the left ſide, one reſpects the Kidney, and the other the Ventricle with the Spleen; but of thoſe which are on the oppoſite ſide, one reſpects the right Kidney, and the other the Liver and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring part.

                     <p>Concerning theſe, in the firſt place, it ſhall be inquire into in general, For what end ſo many nervous infoldings, with almoſt innumerable fibres and ſhoots, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed about the Meſentery and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> For when in theſe parts the fibres and nervous ſhoots are carried on every ſide with ſo thick a ſeries, that they are variouſly infolded with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r manifold meeting, it may ſeem wonderful, if every one of theſe be deſtinated to ſome uſes, and are not rather ſprinkled here and there by chance, and as it were by the inconſiderate ſporting of Nature. And indeed any one can ſcarce think, that ſo many Veſſels ſhould be prepared for the performing the offices of motion or ſenſe in that place. For thoſe <hi>Viſcera,</hi> unleſs highly pulled and affected with a Convulſion, are ſenſible of little or nothing that we know of; and their motions are almoſt no other thing than obſcure Vermiculations or light Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, ſo that for the effecting them there is required no greater preparation than for the ſlow progreſs of a Snail. Wherefore from hence it hath come into the mind of ſome, that a certain Juyce, and that perhaps nutritious, was diſpenſed by this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold paſſage of the nervous Pipes: which ſort of office however if aſſigned to theſe Fibres diſperſed about the Meſentery, why ſhould not the ſame office either of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or of carrying of nouriſhment, be granted to thoſe in like manner divaricated about the Lungs and the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and eſpecially about the rough <hi>Artery?</hi> But truly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107014:112"/>it is highly improbable, that a nutritious Juyce ſhould be contained in the Coats of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> which the nerves may ſuck out; nor does it more clearly appear, why more nerves ſhould be deſtinated for the carrying of the alible Juyce to theſe parts of the Abdomen, or thoſe of the Breaſt, than is needful for the muſculous ſtock. But in the mean time, though we deny, that the whole nutritious matter is carried this way and that way by thoſe or the other nerves; yet we think; that within thoſe nervous paſſages an humor doth perpetually abound, which may be for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, and a Ferment for the nutritious matter: with which going with the nervous humor towards the Inteſtines and to the other ſinks of the Body, it is likely, that the ſuperfluous and excrementitious ſeroſities do often ſlide down together, and ſo are carried out.</p>
                     <p>But it may be well thought, as to the Meſenterick Nerves, and Infoldings in which they are terminated, and the Fibres moſt thickly going out of theſe, that theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of Veſſels are firſt Chanels, then Storehouſes, and laſtly the laſt Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the animal Spirits. If it ſhould be demanded, for what end ſo great plenty of Spirits ſhould be deſigned for theſe ignobler parts; I ſay, that this is done for the performing the acts of Motion and Senſe there, which are highly neceſſary for the preſerving of life it ſelf. For although local motion, which is always performed by the help of a Muſcle, as of a Spring, is not convenient for the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly; yet inteſtine motions are brought forth by them almoſt continually, and after many faſhions: <hi>viz.</hi> for the ſubduing the Chyle, alſo for the ſeparation of ſome parts and particles from others, both of that, and alſo of the bloody Liquor, and the protruſion of every one towards their deſigned bounds, the Fibres and nervous ſhoots reaching into the Membranes of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and the Coats of the Veſſels, yea and into the textures of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are variouſly drawn together, to wit, theſe are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upwards, thoſe downwards; ſometimes many together, ſometimes apart or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, are wont to be drawn hither and thither. In truth, it is a ſign of the in diſcontinued action of theſe <hi>Viſcera,</hi> that as well in ſleep, and perhaps more than in waking, the Culinary work of Nutrition is performed; and whilſt the Organs of the other Faculties are at reſt, there is no quiet granted to theſe: but that the Meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick nerves perpetually grinding in the Mill, are always buſied for the preparing the alible humor and the exporting the ſame towards all parts.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in theſe parts, to which the aforeſaid Nerves belong, there is found an exquiſite feeling no leſs than a motive Faculty; for whatſoever heterogeneous or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, mixed with the Chyle or blood, is brought to any <hi>Viſcera,</hi> preſently the Spirits, inhabiting thoſe parts, being warned of the evil, do greatly tumultuate as it were by entring into a Conſpiracy, that what is hoſtile or troubleſom they might ſhut out. But indeed, becauſe the animal Spirits, flowing by the paſſage of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve to the Inteſtines and <hi>Viſcera</hi> akin to them, proceed from the Cerebel; therefore the buſineſſes of either Faculty, to wit, both the ſenſitive and locomotive, foraſmuch as they are performed the Brain unconſulted, and the animal ſcarce know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are not ſo openly taken notice of, and for that reaſon they are accounted of leſs than the ſpontaneous acts of the other parts.</p>
                     <p>But as to the manner it ſelf or way of the oeconomy, whereby the animal Spirits, deſtinated to the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly, are exerciſed, we affirm, That plenty of them flow into all the Meſentetick infoldings by the paſſage of the nerves ſent from the intercoſtal pair; where being heaped up to a fulneſs, as it were in ſo many Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes or places of Receipt, they are kept to be diſtributed from thence into ſeveral parts, as occaſion requires. But that the Spirits flow out of theſe infoldings, not through ſingular and larger branches, (as is done in the Muſcles) but as it were by Troops of Fibres, into their proper tasks, the reaſon is, becauſe here the buſineſs is performed otherwiſe than in the muſculous ſtock. For where a Muicle is fixed to the part to be moved, its implanted Fibres perform the whole work of Contraction, or of the motive endeavour; but it ſuffices for the nerve ſtill to convey new ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Spirits, and as occaſion ſerves, the Inſtincts of the Motion to be performed: but in the Membranes and the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> where Muſcles are wanting, the nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres themſelves moſt thickly implanted, and diſtributed as it were ſo many little ropes, almoſt into every part of the ſubject, perform the buſineſs of Traction or drawing by themſelves and their own proper endeavour or force partly; and partly ſolicite or ſtir up into motion the Fibres implanted in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> diſpoſed after an uncertain order; which they determinate in their action, and moderate or govern
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107014:113"/>them, as it were ſo many fingers laid upon the ſtrings of a muſical Inſtrument. For although the Membranes and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> themſelves are indued with ſome implanted Fibres; yet theſe are not, as it is in the Muſcles, of one kind and poſition; but in the ſame part ſome are ſtraight, and others oblique or crooked, theſe tend upwards, thoſe downwards, and others are carried round; ſo that divers ſorts of motions ought to be performed in the ſame Membrane or Inward, ſometimes together, ſometimes ſucceſſively or by turns: wherefore diſtinct nerves are required, not only for the ſeveral ſeries of Fibres, but for all the parts of the ſubject, to wit, which may ſtop here a motion begun in that place, and may begin another anew, or may unite one with another. Truly the motion which is performed in the muſculous ſtock ſeems like the rude and more ſimple work of ſome Weaver, where the ſhuttle being always caſt after the ſame manner, the Woof is laid under the Thread or Yarn: but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Inteſtines and <hi>Viſcera</hi> may be aptly compared to a Texture very much variegated or flouriſhed, for the weaving of whoſe more artificial ſubſtance or making there is made uſe of many hands together, or of a Machine diverſly turning about, and furniſhed with more than a thouſand ſorts of motions.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the many Meſenterick Nerves, and Shoots, and nervous Fibres which go out of them by bands, we muſt conſider chiefly theſe two things: to wit, what may be the office of each of them for the ſtirring up of motion or ſenſe, either of them, or both together in any part: then ſecondly, what the communication of either of them may be with other nerves, infoldings or bundles of nerves, by reaſon of which a Sympathy or conſent of actions ariſes at once in divers parts. According to theſe two reſpects we will particularly weigh now the ſeveral nervous Veſſels belonging to the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the left ſide the ſupreme Meſenterick branch being preſently forked like the figure of the Letter Y, contains in its upper ſhoot the Stomachical infolding, which is alſo the Splenetick, and in the other lower the Renal infolding or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Reins. Moreover, about the knot of diviſion it ſends forth ſome ſhoots to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>F. G.</hi> Hence a reaſon is plain, wherefore there happens ſuch affinity between the Ventricle and the Spleen, and between the Meſentery and the Reins, ſo that the very often and familiar Symptom of Vomiting is both in Splenetick, Colical, and Nephritick people: becauſe when a Convulſion is begun in any part or Inward, which the Meſenterick nerve reſpects, preſently other parts, to which the infoldings or ſhoots of the ſame nerve belong, are drawn into conſent.</p>
                     <p>From this lower infolding a little bundle of Nerves being carried towards the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, inſerts its Fibres partly in its bottom, and partly ſends them to meet with other Fibres ſent down from the nerve of the Stomach, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> The reaſon of the former is, That whereas there are many Coats of the Ventricle, and divers ſeries of Fibres are diſpoſed in them, for the actuating all of which with a due influx of animal Spirits, the Stomachical nerves, derived from the wandring pair, are not ſufficient; it was fit, that for the outward Court as it were or Precinct of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to wit, for the outmoſt bottom of it, ſome forces of Spirits might be ſupplied from ſome ſtrange Kingdom, to wit, from the aforeſaid nervous infolding of the Abdomen. Inſtead of this, Spirits alſo may ſlide downwards from the ſame Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical branch through other Fibres ſent down, and be ſent into this Splenetick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding. Beſides alſo it is obſerved, That the adventitious nerves aptly conſpire with the former, being of the proper dominion of the Ventricle, and that either are not only inoculated within the confines of the Inward it ſelf, but they run into mutual embraces without it, and as it were joyn hands together.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems plain, that the nervous Filaments being carried from the aforeſaid infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bottom of the Ventricle, may ſerve there for the performing the acts of Motion and Senſation: but it doth not ſo eaſily appear with what office the other handful of Fibres reaching out from hence into the Spleen is charged (<hi>Fig.</hi> 11. ζ.) becauſe this Inward is ſaid to be deſtitute wholly of every animal Faculty. When we did elſewhere inquire into the uſe of the Spleen, we thought good to affirm, That its office was to ſeparate the dregs of the Blood and the acid-ſaline Particles, and whatſoever were of a more fixed nature, and to concoct them more being received into its own boſom, and to convert them into an acid Ferment; by which being again delivered to the blood through the Veins, a ſharpneſs and an aſperity, as alſo an active or fermentative virtue are gotten forits <hi>Latex.</hi> Wherefore the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107014:113"/>of the Spleen conſiſts of a texture of Fibres in the form of a net; to wit, that the Feculencies of the blood might be more plentifully received, and contained within its ſpongy cavities and thick paſſages. I ſay therefore, that for the fit preſerving and diſpenſing of the Splenetick Ferment, beſides the Arteries which carry matter, and the Veins which continually ſup back ſome portion of the ſame fermented, there ſeems to be need of many nerves alſo, which both by pulling the fibrous texture of the Spleen, might cauſe the melancholick and dark <hi>Faces,</hi> laid up in it, to be ſhaken together, and ſo by defending it from putrefaction and coagulation, cauſe it to be imbued with an acid and fermentative nature; and alſo that thoſe nerves may ſometimes draw together and conſtrain the blood carrying Veſſels, ſometimes open and inlarge them; that as occaſion ſerves, the Feculencies of the blood may be ſometimes more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes more ſparingly laid aſide out of the Arteries into the Spleen; alſo that more or leſs of the Ferment, preſerved in the Spleen, may be poured out on the blood according to the requirings of the Paſſions or of the natural Inſtinct. No Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack but doth abundantly perceive, that ſome Splenetick nerves do perform motions; for thoſe great perturbations which are wont to be excited in the left ſide, as when ſometimes Inflations, ſometimes conſtrictions of the inward parts, and ſometimes various concuſſions are perceived with a wandring pain running here and there, they are only Spaſms or Convulſions or wrinklings t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ther, with which the nerves of the Spleen are ordinarily affected. Nor do its nerves, taken with a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſtir up tumults only in the neighbourhood of the Spleen, but oftentimes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Heart it ſelf, yea into the whole Body the effects of their inordinations are carried. I have known an Hypochondriack, who preſently upon the Spleen being diſturbed, ſeemed to have his <hi>Pracordia,</hi> being drawn downwards, to be cruelly preſt and bound together; ſo that being very ſad and dejected in his mind, alſo complaining of an exceeding great ſtraitneſs and conſtriction of his Breaſt, he thought himſelf almoſt dead. The cauſe of which kind of diſtemper was without doubt, that when many Fibres going out of the Splenetick infolding are united with other Fibres ſent from the fartheſt end of the wandring pair, it eaſily happens, that the former, being diſtempered with the Convulſion, do draw together and pull downwards their yoke-fellows, and by conſequence the Trunk it ſelf of the wandring pair, from which the nerves are ſent into the <hi>Praecordia:</hi> certainly by the <hi>Sympraxis</hi> or joynt action of either kind of the aforeſaid nerves, <hi>viz.</hi> whereof theſe reſpect the Spleen, thoſe the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> it is effected, that the Trembling, Oppreſſion, and other grievous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Heart, as alſo of the Spleen, ſo ordinarily happen. Further, foraſmuch as the Fermentation of the blood depends on the Spleen, according to the influence of this, that performs its Circulation, ſometimes pleaſantly, ſometimes diſturbedly. Whilſt the Spleen is at quiet, and free from any perturbation, the blood alſo is quietly moved in Hypochondriacal perſons; but if the ſame be moved and exerciſed, (as it is wont to be in any paſſion or violent motion of the Body, or by a Medicine) preſently its nerves being diſtempered with a Convulſion, ſhake it more with reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated contractions; ſo that the fermentative Feculencies, being ſhaken out of its boſom, flow back more plentifully into the blood, which cauſe its <hi>Latex</hi> preſently to be troubled, and as it were muddy, and ſharpen it with ſo great acrimony and mordacity, that it burns and pricks the Brain and Heart like needles; from whence in Splenetick people, beſides that the Reaſon is obſcured, the affections of the Mind, eſpecially Sadneſs, Hatred, and Anger are very much increaſed.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Splenetick Nerves, by another conjecture, we are yet brought to believe, that they, beſides the exerciſe of the motive Faculty, do both inſtil into the Spleen its own humor, which promotes the fermentative virtue of that Inward; and alſo (becauſe the nerves, as was ſhewn already, convey the Spirits, and ſometimes the humors by either way, <hi>viz.</hi> forward and backward) the ſame implanted in the Spleen, do often imbibe from it an acetous or Vinegar-like humor, and as it were Vitriolick, from whoſe acrimony and notable twitching, they are forced into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as the nervous Infolding reſpecting the Spleen, communicates more nearly with the Ventricle, Meſentery, Liver, and Kidneys, and more remotely with the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and other parts placed at a diſtance; from hence the cauſe is plain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only theſe ſeveral <hi>Viſcera</hi> and parts, by reaſon of the fault of the Spleen, are folded together; but alſo on the contrary, why the Spleen being indiſpoſed by any Diſeaſe, or trouble raiſed up in any of thoſe parts, is wont to be diſturbed: ſo it is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107014:114"/>not altogether for nothing, that the Symptoms every where infeſting, the cauſe of them being unknown, are aſcribed ordinarily to the Spleen; becauſe it fixes not only its own inordinations in other parts, but alſo ſuffers for their peculiar faults: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is wrongfully aſcribed to Vapours tranſmitted from this or that part, when the formal reaſon of every Diſtemper of this kind for the moſt part conſiſts in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication made through the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>The lower Infolding of the left ſide ſeems to be made for the Kidney placed near, into which chiefly the bundle of its Fibres is carried, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. ♃. Υ. Υ. Certainly that theſe nerves, following the emulgent Veſſels, do embrace the ſame, and bind them about with a various and frequent complication; that is ſo made for that end, that by reaſon of the Artery being ſo ſtrained and frequently ſhaken by the drawings of the nerves, the Serum may the more eaſily be precipitated from the blood: wherefore it is obſerved in very great difficulty or danger, when the mind and all the nerves are ſtrained for fear, that a frequent and more plentiful making of water, and that often painful, is wont to be provoked.</p>
                     <p>The Renal Infolding receives, beſides the Nerve common to it with the upper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, another new and peculiar one from the intercoſtal nerve, or rather that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming between from the ſpinal Marrow, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. β. Hence it is, that the Loyns have a great conſent with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Foraſmuch as this infolding communicates with the greateſt of the Meſentery, the Colick diſtemper and the Nephritick are much akin, and it is often difficult to diſtinguiſh their fits one from the other.</p>
                     <p>The Meſenterick branch in the right ſide, as well as the left, being forked, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two infoldings: the upper of theſe (which we call the Hepatick) ſends forth from it ſelf many little bundles of nervous Fibres; the greateſt of which being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards the Liver, cloaths the Hepatick Artery as it were with a Net made of Fibres, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. ♂. <hi>o.</hi> The moſt Learned <hi>Gliſſon</hi> obſerves, That the Hepatick Artery is beſtowed on the Trunks of the Veſſels, to wit, of the common Cheſt, of the bilary Pore, and of the <hi>Vena Porta;</hi> for the watering of which, and for the actuating them with heat and nouriſhing Juyce, it carries the arterious Blood; to which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for the recarrying, an aſſociate Vein is wholly wanting: wherefore that ought to carry the blood, not with a full and free influx, but by little and little, and always in a conſtant meaſure to thoſe membranaceous parts: for otherwiſe there had been danger, leſt from the bloody <hi>Latex</hi> plentifully ruſhing forward, for that it could not be ſtill remanded preſently through the Veins, an Inflammation ſhould be excited, or leſt from its torrent being transfuſed beyond its banks, the courſes of the other rivers in the Liver ſhould be diſturbed. But for that the nerves, like Reins, do bind about the Trunk of the Artery, the inflowing of the blood it ſelf is moderated, and they cauſe it variouſly to be diſpenſed according to the wants of thoſe parts to which it is deſtinated.</p>
                     <p>From the Troop of Nerves going out towards the Liver, ſome bend down into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and others into the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels, <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and ſow into them thick ſeries of ſhoots, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. π. π. The office of theſe ſeems to be, to pull together the excretory paſſages of thoſe parts, and to ſhake them for the cauſing Evacuations of the boiling or turging humors upon occaſion. Further, from theſe Fibres being carried upwards, when many others ſent from either Stomachical nerve are united, the reaſon is plain, why from an hawling or pulling made about the Ventricle, the yellow Bile is drawn out of the Gall-cheſt into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> which being carried from thence into the Ventricle, by reaſon of a Convulſion of that ſame Inteſtine, is caſt up by Vomit: becauſe the Stomachical nerves being irritated by a Medicine, or by any troubleſom thing, for the making an Evacuation above, and for that cauſe drawn from thence upwards, they draw together the nerves belonging to the Liver and the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels, for that they are tied to them, and bring them into conſent with the ſuperior Spaſm or Convulſion. Hence it happens, that not only the Stomach being firſt tired, draws to it ſelf the Bile by its Convulſion, and allures it into its own boſom; but the Bile alſo of its own accord growing turgid, and ſo being poured out into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> foraſmuch as it irritates the nerves of this Inteſtine, and then by their conſent, provokes the nervous Veſſels of the Ventricle, it preſently induces a cholerick Vomiting.</p>
                     <p>The Hepatick Infolding communicates with the Splenetick by Fibres going between either, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. θ. The reaſon of which ſeems to be, That when one infolding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107014:114"/>the end or the right extremity of the Ventricle, and another the left; that a conſent in either and a joynt action may be made towards the Stomach, both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate between themſelves by nerves, as if <hi>Internuntii.</hi> Truly it ſeems to come to paſs by the paſſage of theſe nerves, that the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> pains oftentimes run from the left ſide into the right; to wit, for that a Spaſm or Convulſion begun in the Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick infolding, is wont to be carried to the Hepatick.</p>
                     <p>Between the <hi>Hepatick</hi> Infolding and the greateſt of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> many Fibres reaching out by bands, are caſt out in the midſt, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>p. p.</hi> the office of which is to ſuſtain a certain commerce and Sympathy; to wit, ſuch an one is required, both that the Chyle may be miniſtred from the Inteſtines towards the Liver ſtill in due proportion, alſo that the Bible may opportunely ſlide out from the Gall-bladder into the Inteſtines for the provoking of Excretion. For we are of this Opinion, That the Meſeraick Veins ſucking out a certain portion of the Chyle from the Inteſtines, immediately transfer it through the region of the Liver into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> whereby the blood in the aſcending Trunk of the hollow Vein or <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> might be freſhly imbued with nouriſhing Juyce; even as in its deſcending Trunk it is refreſhed, the ſame being poured out through the <hi>Thoracical</hi> Veſſels or thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Wherefore it is needful, that there ſhould be a very ſtrict affinity between theſe <hi>Viſcera;</hi> and the rather, becauſe the Bile ought to be poured out from the Gall cheſt to the Inteſtines, not continually, but for ſome uſes, by occaſions and intervals. For the Nerves knowing beſt the wants of either part, warn them both of their mutual duty, and as occaſion ſerves, ſtir them into action.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved, That in the right ſide an ample Nerve is ſtretched out between the <hi>Hepatick</hi> and <hi>Renal</hi> infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. μ. So that between theſe infoldings a greater and more immediate conſent is had, than between thoſe pairs of the other ſide. The reaſon of which doth not eaſily appear, unleſs perhaps it ſhould be ſo made for this end, that when from the Reins, in making of water, there is an endeavour of the ſerous Excretion, the <hi>Pylorus</hi> and the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels being at once drawn down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, a protruſion of the Chyle and <hi>Faeces</hi> might be provoked towards the lower parts of the Belly. Certainly this connexion of theſe infoldings is chiefly the cauſe, why oftentimes moſt cruel Vomiting uſes to come upon a Fit of the Stone; and that from ſuch a Vomiting the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels are very much emptied, as if provoked by taking an Emetick.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Infolding of the Meſentery being placed in the midſt of the reſt, like the Sun, diſperſes every where round about nervous Fibres like rays, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. ☉. and caſts them not only on every one of thoſe infoldings, as if ſo many Planets with a peculiar Aſpect, or <hi>Actinoboliſm</hi> or Irradiation, but alſo it diſtributes them into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inteſtines, ſanguiferous Veſſels, and other parts lying round about: without doubt upon theſe nervous Filaments, which are carried from this infolding to the Inteſtines, as Lines from the Centre to the Circumference, every action of the Inteſtines, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Periſtaltick motion of the Vermiculation, depends; namely for that theſe Fibres do move ſucceſſively, and ſtill move further every begun action, as it were with a ſpiral or Screw-like progreſs.</p>
                     <p>That from this Infolding many Fibres and ſhoots going forth, are inſerted into the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> nigh its deſcending, and that theſe reaching towards the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, accompany the Blood carrying Veſſels, and in ſeveral places climb over them; from hence it may be inferred, That nerves alſo in the Abdomen are like Bridles and Reins caſt on the ſanguiferous Veſſels, which either by ſtraining or pulling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may ſometimes retard, ſometimes incite the courſe of the blood according to the needs of the lower <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the greateſt Infolding of the <hi>Meſentery</hi> ſome noted Fibres and ſhoots are ſent out into the <hi>Glandula's</hi> of the Womb or the Womens Teſticles, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. τ. τ. Into which alſo other ſhoots from the Trunk of the intercoſtal Nerve, <hi>ibid. v.v.</hi> and others going out of the nerve which comes between this infolding and the loweſt of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, do come together, <hi>ibid.</hi> ψ. ψ. So that a proviſion of Spirits is carried into thoſe parts from a threefold Store-houſe; which indeed is much larger than is done in the other Sex, when we find ſcarce any nerve to belong to mens Teſticles. Indeed the Womb, beſides that it is a very ſenſible part, ought alſo to be moved diverſly, and in bringing forth a child very ſtrongly: wherefore there are granted to this both more ſtrong implanted Fibres, and alſo Nerves of a various kind and original.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the Infoldings of the Abdomen, but eſpecially the loweſt, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107014:115"/>to it the greateſt of the Meſentery, are oftentimes affected in the Paſſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Hyſterical, as ſhall be preſently declared. Therefore if at any time ſuch diſtempers proceed from the Womb, the cauſe is manifeſt wherefore the aforeſaid infoldings are drawn into conſent. But we have elſewhere ſhewn, That thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions are merely convulſive, and not ſeldom excited without any fault in the Womb. Further, that Symptom very frequent in thoſe kind of Fits, to wit, in which as it were a Globe is perceived to be carried from the bottom of the Belly, and about the Navel to leap out impetuouſly, which therefore is thought to be an aſcent of the Womb; I ſay, that it is nothing elſe than moſt cruel Convulſions of theſe infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Indeed oftentimes in Women, and ſometimes alſo in Men, I have known when the convulſive Affection hath invaded, that a bulk in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> hath been ſeen to ariſe, then about the midſt of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> ſo great a ſwelling to follow, that it could not be hindred or preſt down, though ſtrongly attempted by the hands of a ſtrong man. Without doubt, the cauſe of this admirable diſtemper is, that within the nerves of the intercoſtal pair the inflowing animal Spirits, as often as they begin diſorders or convulſive motions, firſt (as it is wont to be) begin to grow hot or to be exploded about the extremities of the nerve, to wit, in the loweſt infolding of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> which affection of theirs, when creeping upwards it is carried to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, ſo that the Spirits inhabiting it are taken with the like inordination, it is no wonder, if that ſwelling up of the middle of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> and as it were an exploſion of a certain nitroſulphureous matter, ſhould be ſtirred up. For truly it is not probable, that that Symptom ſhould be excited from the Womb aſcending and being removed from its place, becauſe, beſides this part being fixed in its place and firmly eſtabliſhed with Ligaments, the bulk of it alſo in Virgins is ſo ſmall, ſcarce exceeding the bigneſs of a Walnut, that although it ſhould be carried up into the Belly, it could not produce ſuch a ſwelling. Not is it more likely, that this ſort of diſtemper is ſtirred up from the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> taken with a Convulſion: for they, however convulſive, draw together themſelves and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts upwards or downwards, or of one ſide, but they are not able by any means to bear themſelves aloſt, and to lift up on high, with a force, the region of the Navel. But, as we ſuppoſe, the animal Spirits in the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery growing fierce, and becoming apt to be exploded, (as ſuch indeed they are whenever they enter into convulſive motions) they being there gathered round thickly into a Globe, do mainly blow up and lift on high with their efferveſcency and notable rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that infolding with its whole neighbourhood, and at once drive upward the <hi>Viſcera</hi> lying upon it with a certain vibration or ſhaking. A more full explication of this Symptom belongs to the Pathology of the Brain and Nerves.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time we ſhall take notice, that another certain Diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Colical</hi> grief doth belong to the infoldings of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and eſpecially to this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Meſentery. For it may be thought, that the moſt cruel torments that are wont to be excited in this diſeaſe do come, not from an excrementitions matter ſhut up in the cavities of the Inteſtines, nor always from a ſharp humor impacted in their Coats, but oftner from the nervous Juyce imbued with a certain acrimony, and ſtagnating within this infolding; from whence, by reaſon of a conſent of this with the infoldings both Hepatick and Splenetick, a frequent and cruel Vomiting comes upon theſe pains. But theſe <hi>Pathologick</hi> Speculations being referred to their places, we will follow what we firſt of all inſtituted, the further paſſage of the intercoſtal Nerve, by which we are led to the two leſſer and loweſt Infoldings of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Below the Meſenterick Nerves, out of which the ſuperior Infoldings are made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcending intercoſtal Trunk ſends forth three or four ſingular ſhoots, which are carried into the Ureters, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>v.v.</hi> The uſe of theſe ſeems to be, to pull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to jog or ſhake thoſe urinary Chanels, that the Serum ſeparated in the Reins, may be the more readily drawn out towards the Bladder. Moreover, if at any time a viſcous or muddy matter doth ſtick to the paſſages of the Ureters, or a more fixed ſtone doth obſtruct their Cavities, they, by the help of the Nerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted here and there in their whole tract, being pulled together and wrinkled, may preſs down and always move for ward any bulk or ſubſtance ſtaying in the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>Nigh the <hi>Vertebra,</hi> out of which the Crural Nerves begin to go forward, three diſtinct branches brought to either intercoſtal Nerve, are carried from thence into the loweſt hollowneſs of the Belly, where they make the infolding which is the loweſt of the <hi>Abdomen, Fig.</hi> 11. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> φ. φ. φ. That here ſo many nerves, to wit, ſix large ones
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107014:115"/>joyning together do make but a ſmall infolding, <hi>viz.</hi> a leſſer than is raiſed higher in a ſingle branch of the nerve; the reaſon is, becauſe this infolding is like an Inn, where the inflowing Spirits dwell no long time, but it receiving them only in their paſſage, preſently commits them to other infoldings placed here and there above, below, and of one ſide, and made for divers offices; for from hence the chief paſſage, and as it were a broad way, leads to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery; moreover, from hence nerves, diverſly going out, make three other infoldings, which reſpect the parts and ways by which the ſeveral Excretions, to wit, of the Dung, Urine, and Seed, are made in the lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Nerve therefore ſent out of this loweſt Infolding into the greateſt of the Meſentery, a little before it reaches to it, imparts two noted ſhoots to the Glandula's of the Womb; but in its aſcent it admits four other branches, as it were ſubſidiary, <hi>viz.</hi> two on either ſide from the intercoſtal pair, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. χ. ſo that the nerve here ſeems to be the chief means of paſſage of the animal Spirits deſtinated to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery and to the uterine Glandula's; which paſſage however is carried into the deſigned parts, not immediately, but a compaſs being made, it firſt goes forward beyond its bound, and at length with a certain going back. The reaſon of which is, that the motions of all the Inteſtines, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vermiculations ſhould be directed downwards towards the ſtraight Inteſtine, and alſo that the actions of the Womb ſhould tend thither; therefore 'twas fit, that the animal Spirits ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied from below whither the motion inclined. For by the like means, this Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terick nerve and the two returning nerves, being firſt carried lower, aſcend into their Provinces; to wit, that they may pull together the reſpective parts toward that bound placed below, as it were to a Pully.</p>
                     <p>Further, for this end, to wit, that the influence of the Spirits actuating ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, might be derived lower; the other infolding of the Abdomen, to wit, the leaſt, is added immediately to this. Becauſe upon the Nerves being carried from hence about an inch, there grows a ſmall infolding; out of which, one nerve being ſent out into the greateſt infolding of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> ſtretches it ſelf under the top of the ſtraight Inteſtine and part of the <hi>Colon, Fig.</hi> 11. ☿. α. And another nerve, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this infolding, is carried under the loweſt part of the ſame ſtraight Inteſtine, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>b.</hi> which alſo, two ſhoots carried from the infoldings placed in the <hi>Pelvis</hi> or Baſon, meet, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>d. d.</hi> It will not be hard to declare the uſes of this infolding and its nerves: becauſe all thoſe nervous paſſages are emptied about the offices and motions of the ſtraight Inteſtine. The aſcending nerve directs the Vermiculations of the ſame ſtraight Inteſtine, as alſo of the lower part of the Colon, and then (the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery mediating) of ſome other Inteſtines to be made downwards; but the deſcending nerve, in oppoſition to the other, drawing the loweſt part of the ſtraight Inteſtine upwards, takes care that the Excrements being carried towards the Arſe-hole, may not ſlide out ſuddenly and unexpectedly. Then foraſmuch as two nerves from the two infoldings placed within the Baſon or Tunnel, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings immediately admitting a noted Vertebral branch, are partakers of the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Function) meet with this deſcending nerve, and are ingraffed into it; it comes to paſs from all of them together, that the Excrements being detained at the doors, when it ſhall be convenient, the Appetite commanding, are caſt out. Nature, that it might ſhun filthineſs, is ſo careful, that for the carrying out of the Excrements it conſtitutes nervous Veſſels, with as noted a proviſion, as for the performing any where of the moſt ſplendid offices.</p>
                     <p>From the loweſt Infolding of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> two nerves being ſent into the Tunnel, receive there on both ſides a noted Vertebral Nerve; and ſo conſtitute two infoldings, to wit, one in either ſide, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>C.C. K.K.</hi> Theſe infoldings near the doors, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the chief excretory paſſages, ſerve for the opening and ſhutting them: a Vertebral branch comes to either as a ſupply; by which it comes to paſs, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the increaſing the forces of the Spirits, their acts flowing from theſe infoldings, become in ſome meaſure ſpontaneous. By what means and for what end, the nerve aſcending from either infolding, is beſtowed on the ſtraight Inteſtine, was ſhewn but now. Moreover, two deſcending on both ſides, are carried into the neck or porch of the Womb, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>e.g.</hi> Without doubt, whatever of ſenſe or motion is made about the Venereal acts, is owed to the influence of the Spirits through theſe Nerves. In Men the delightful profuſion of the Genital humor, and in Women the no leſs pleaſant reception of the ſame depends on the action of thoſe nerves. Laſtly,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107014:116"/>from the ſame infolding another nerve deſcending and broken into certain ſhoots, is diſtributed on both ſides into the Bladder and its Sphincter, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>f.</hi> Certainly by theſe nerves the buſineſs of making water is performed, and when at any time the ſame is painful, the troubleſom ſenſe is impreſſed on them. But foraſmuch as the nerves dedicated to the ſeveral Excretions proceed on both ſides from the ſame infolding, therefore the acts of them all are in ſome meaſure alike among themſelves, ſo indeed, that if any excretory paſſage ſhould be weak or ill affected, it ſends forth its charge which it ſhould keep, whether it will or no. This is ſo well known, that there is no need to illuſtrate the matter with inſtances.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Nerves and Infoldings being ſo made, there is not much buſineſs beſides left for the intercoſtal pair. About the beginning of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> both Trunks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining mutually one to the other, communicate among themſelves by a croſs ſhoot or two, then they end in very ſmall Fibres, which are diſtributed into the Sphincter of the <hi>Anus, Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>q. r. s.</hi> Here the intercoaſt pair is after the ſame manner, as we have obſerved concerning the wandring pair; to wit, either nerve being brought to the end of its courſe, before they enter upon their laſt task, incline themſelves to mutual embraces. Concerning the laſt offices of either pair, this Conformity may be alſo noted; that whenas the <hi>Viſcera</hi> dedicated to Chylification, to wit, the Ventricle and Inteſtines, are ſtill continued to the laſt by the ſame paſſage and the ſame perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cavity or hollowneſs; the firſt doors of this Cavity, to wit, the Orifices of the Ventricle, are kept by the loweſt branches of the wandring pair joyned among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but before the laſt door of the ſame, to wit, the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> the extremities of the intercoſtal pair, alſo before joyned among themſelves, are placed. But to this part, as if it had never provided enough for it, beſides the nerves ſent hither from either infolding next above, and theſe extreme productions of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal pair beſtowed on it, a branch alſo and certain fibres from the Vertebral nerve are inſerted, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>i. k.</hi> By the acceſs of which it comes to paſs, that the ſhutting and opening of this door-keeping Muſcle becomes ſpontaneous. Truly many nerves, and thoſe of a diverſe kind, are diſtributed into the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nutritious Juyce and its ſtinking recrements, like a certain Chymical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are digeſted within the Inteſtines, as it were within a <hi>Matrace;</hi> therefore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which beſt underſtands Chymiſtry, is very careful about the well-ſtopping the mouths of the Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame Nerve, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt Vertebral, out of which a branch diſperſes fibres into the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> two other Nerves proceed, which are carried into the Yard, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>l. m.</hi> The greater of theſe, which is very large and long, is diſtributed into the nervous Body of it; the other leſſer, into its Muſcles. This mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe it receives nerves only from the ſpinal Marrow, according to our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, ought to ſwell up and to be moved only at the ſpontaneous pleaſure of the will: but that oftentimes, by reaſon of the ſwelling up of the Genital ſeed or humor, it is erected and blown up with Spirit, whether one will or no, that is cauſed chiefly for this reaſon, Becauſe from this Vertebral pair, from whence the nerves of the Yard ariſe, a nervous proceſs is ſtretched out into the Vertebral pair next above it: in which the infolding, placed in the Tunnel, imparting nerves to the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> is radicated, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>I. K.</hi> into which infolding alſo a noted nerve from the intercoſtal pair is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. When therefore a communication is had between the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend much on the intercoſtal Nerves and the Yard, (by reaſon of the roots of either being joyned together by the nervous proceſs) it comes to paſs, that the action of this follows the affection of thoſe parts: but thoſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> are apt to be moved not only by the turgeſcency of the Seed, but alſo by the paſſage of the intercoſtal Nerve are wont to be irritated with too unſeaſonable an action, according to the impreſſions made by the Senſes or the Brain; into the conſent of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Yard is excited.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Nerves which belong to the Teſticles, here is not much to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for we have often ſought in vain for a great company of nervous paſſages in them: I have very diligently ſearched ſometimes in Man, alſo in a Fox, Dog, Calf, and likewiſe in a Boar and Monkey, but could never find belonging to them but one nerve carried from the Vertebral pair, which alſo for the moſt part is beſtowed on the Cremaſteral Muſcle, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>M.</hi> ſo that, although an excellent humor is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared within thoſe parts, yet it doth not eaſily appear, that its matter is derived thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the nerves; for we think the Genital humor is no more diſpenſed by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107014:116"/>the nerves than the nutritious. For truly it ſeems, that the Arteries inſtil a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liquor into the Teſticles after the ſame manner as in the Brain; wherefore in their neighbourhood theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels being very much divaricated or ſpread abroad, are turned about into little ſerpentine chanels, whereby they ſubtilize the humor deſtinated to the Teſticles, and inſinnate it, having put off all thickneſs and Feculency, and being truly ſublimated, into their ſubſtance; becauſe there, as within the Cortex of the Brain, the ſpirituous liquor being imbued with a volatile Salt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the part, paſſes into the moſt noble <hi>Clyſſus, viz.</hi> the Genital humor. But here is not a place to diſcourſe more largely of the nature and origine of the Seed: yet becauſe it is commonly objected, That the Seed is made of the nervous Juyce and plenty of Spirits fetched from the Brain, and therefore a large expence of it doth induce quickly on the Brain and Nerves a great debility and enervation; I ſay, this comes to paſs, becauſe after great profuſions of the Seed, for the reſtauration of the ſame humor, (of which Nature is more ſolicitous than for the benefit of the individual) preſently greater Tributes of the ſpirituous Liquor are required from the blood to be laid up into the Teſticles: wherefore the Brain is made languid, being defrauded of its due ſtock and afflux of the ſame ſpirituous liquor; and the Spirits influencing it and the nervous <hi>Syſtem,</hi> becauſe they are deficient in the Fountain it ſelf, are very much depauperated and become flagging. Beſides we may add, That the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits alſo which actuate the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> coming from the ſpinal Marrow, are conſumed about the Venereal acts very much; ſo that the Loyns are alſo enervated for this reaſon.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter we have unfolded the Nerves of the wandring and intercoſtal pair, which being Executers of the involuntary Function, are ſtretched out to the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> and all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the middle and lower Belly, and alſo to ſome other parts: Next to theſe follow ſome other Nerves communicating with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid in their beginning, or in the exerciſe of the ſame office, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpinal Nerve and the Nerve of the Diaphragma; of which we will ſpeak in order.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſhewn, that the Nerve of the wandring pair in the beginning is made up of numerous Fibres: to which is joyned another noted Nerve ariſing from afar, and being ingraffed with them, goes forth together with them out of the Skull. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Nerve, becauſe the beginning and diſtribution of it being very irregular, have not as yet been noted by other Anatomiſts, it may ſeem worth our labour to make a little more diligent inquiry. Therefore if we would ſearch into the beginning of this nerve, that is found beginning with a ſharp point in the ſide of the ſpinal Marrow nigh the ſixth or ſeventh <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, <hi>Fig.</hi> 12. <hi>C. C.</hi> But being increaſed in its aſcent, is no where inſerted into the medullar Trunk, but in its whole tract on both ſides leans on its ſide, to which it is knit by certain admitted Fibres towards the ſuperficies. This ariſing up from the Neck after this manner, and being carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Skull, is joyned to the Fibres of the wandring pair, and is ingraffed with them ſeeming to grow together into one Trunk, and goes out with them at the ſame hole from the Skull; which being paſſed through, the ſpinal Nerve preſently departing from the Trunk of the wandring pair, is at length reflected outward, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. ♀. ♂. This ſtranger or travelling nerve after a ſhort commerce having left his companion, is carried upon the Muſcles of the Neck, to which it imparts ſome ſhoots, and is inoculated with a certain ſhoot of the tenth pair; but from thence being carried on further, it goes alone by a long paſſage, till it comes to the Scapular Muſcle, on which it is almoſt wholly beſtowed, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. This nerve is found conſtantly, not only in Man and four-footed Beaſts, but alſo in Fowls and Fiſhes; and in theſe it ſeems to be deſtinated inſtead of Arms, and for the moving of their wings and fins.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the uſe of this Nerve, and the reaſon of its irregular beginning, we
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107014:117"/>ſhall conjecture after this manner: Foraſmuch as that is deſtinated for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of the Muſcles belonging to the Arms and Neck, therefore it ought to ariſe out of the ſpinal Marrow: but that it is not carried by a direct and near way into its Province, but being carried about by a long compaſs before it enters upon its task, communicates in its beginning with the nerve of the wandring pair; certainly this ſeems to be done, to the end that this Spinal nerve, being carried into the parts of the wandring pair, might perform the acts of the Function only involuntary. And indeed it may be obſerved, That beſides the ſpontaneous motions wherewith the Neck and Arms are wont to be imployed with the previous intention of doing this or that thing, thoſe parts alſo, before any other member, are affected with pathetick and ſudden motions, according to the force of the Paſſions, the animal not being conſcious of it. For almoſt all living Creatures do not only turn about their necks at any noiſe to behold whatever might cauſe fear; but they being any ways affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the twinkling of an eye fly away, their feet, wings, fins, or other part an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to them, being ſet into a rapid motion. The Neck and the Arms are pliable or obſervant, not only to fear, but in like manner to the other Paſſions. For brute Animals, as well as Man, being puffed up with pride or anger, (as we have elſewhere intimated) have their Necks ſwollen, and their Creſts lifted up: But as to Man, his hands and arms are ſo obſequious to the Paſſions, and almoſt to all the conceptions of the Brain, that they are continually agitated in the doing of any other thing with various geſtures, whereof we are ignorant or not willing them: we ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think or ſpeak any thing but at the ſame time the hands are flung out here and there; and whilſt the Tongue heſitates or ſticks, or the words at it were ſtick between the Jaws, the right hand is exerciſed, as if by its geſture it were endeavouring to draw out more ſwiftly the ſence of the mind. Truly that theſe parts, to wit, the Hands and Arms, do ſo nearly conſpire with the Affections of the Brain and Heart in their motions in ſome meaſure in all living Creatures, but more eminently in Man, the cauſe ſeems to be this nerve's coming from the ſpinal Marrow to the beginning of the wandring pair, and communicating with its nerves, and receiving from them as it were the note or private mark of the involuntary Function.</p>
                     <p>So much for the ſpinal Nerve, which alſo like a ſhrub, growing from other ſnrubs, hath no peculiar origine, but having received various fibres, is radicated for the greateſt part in the ſpinal Marrow, and (as hath been ſhewn) partly in the nerve of the wandring pair. Concerning the nerve of the Diaphragma, (of which we ſhall ſpeak next) many things occur no leſs worthy remarking. As to its beginning, it may be obſerved, That it ariſes from the brachial nerves with a double or triple root; to wit, two or three ſhoots going out of the aforeſaid nerves, grow together into the ſame Trunk, which is the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> In man its firſt ſhoot, which is alſo the greateſt, is produced out of the ſecond Vertebral nerve; and when the firſt brachial nerve ariſes from the ſame handful of Vertebral nerves going out at this place, the aforeſaid ſhoot is rooted in its origine: wherefore, when in Brutes the firſt brachial nerve ariſes from the fourth or fifth Vertebral, the nerve of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> alſo begins its riſe far lower: two other ſhoots ariſe out of the ſame ſtocks of the brachial nerves which follow next, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>Y.</hi> γ. φ. But the Trunk which is made out of theſe ſhoots goes forward ſingle through the paſſage of the Neck and the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> without any branching forth, even to the <hi>Diaphragma, Fig.</hi> 9 χ. where being at laſt ſtretched out into three or four ſhoots, it is inſerted on either ſide to the fleſhy or muſculous part of it: ſo that, becauſe the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is a Muſcle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms both its motions, to wit, <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> by its own Fibres, the office of either nerve is only to carry bands or forces of animal Spirits requiſite for the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued action of that part, and alſo to convey thither the Inſtincts of the Motions variouſly to be performed.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt uſe of this Nerve, <hi>viz.</hi> for the paſſage of the animal Spirits, the buſineſs is performed in this Muſcle, as it is in the Heart. The Spirits flowing into the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> by the nerves, receive ſubſidiary Forces, to wit, a ſulphureous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula from the blood, upon whoſe exploſion being ſtill iterated by turns, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of new, the action of this perpetual moveable depends. Concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of the Motions tranſmitted by the paſſage of this double nerve, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That they are, eſpecially in man, of a double kind: <hi>viz.</hi> either the action of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> merely natural for the performing of Reſpiration, is continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocated according to the uſes of the Heart and Lungs, and altered many ways in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107014:117"/>their tenour according to their needs, or ſecondly, a certain irregular and unuſual motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is wont to be excited at the beck of the Appetite, or from the inſtigations of other parts; for the which, whilſt the reſt of the Organs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration are compelled to conſpire, the act it ſelf of Reſpiration becomes after a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner interrupted or unequal.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the unforced motion of this Muſcle, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> with the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi> and the parts of either, conſpire in their motion with the action of the Lungs and Heart: and that between all theſe ſuch a joynt action may be ſuſtained, it is obſerved, That three or four bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are ſent out from the Vertebral nerves, in the branches of which the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is rooted, into the intercoſtal infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. Θ. and whereas from this infolding the nerves are carried into the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> by this means a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and conſent of action is effected between theſe and the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> drawing with it ſelf the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> by reaſon of other nerves, conſpires with the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> Theſe in man going from the intercoſtal nerve, are already deſcribed; and in Brutes from the lower infolding of the wandring pair a nerve is ſent down into the infolding of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> to which beſides ſo many ſhoots and certain fibres reaching forth into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> are inſtead of ſuch a commerce.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Anomal and irregular motions of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> proceed from various cauſes and from the divers inſtigation of other parts, which alſo in man become much more ſignal than in brute Animals; becauſe in him the communication is notable by the nerves reaching out from the Cervical infolding of the intercoſtal pair into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> which kind of infolding and nerves are wanting in Brutes.</p>
                     <p>As to the Species themſelves of irregular motions into which the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is wont to be perverted, it may be obſerved, That we are able at our pleaſure to ſtop breathing or reſpiration for ſome ſpace, and preſently to take it or draw it out. In laughing, weeping, and ſinging ſometimes the <hi>Syſtole,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> becomes ſtronger, and is made frequenter upward or downward with a repeated ſhaking; which ſort of actions of it are made by reaſon of thoſe near com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces had between the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and other reſpective parts of the Breaſt and Face: yea indeed from hence it is effected, (as we have already ſhewn) that man is peculiarly a laughing Creature. Further, (which we have ſhewn elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) from the Sympathy which happens between the parts of the Mouth and Face with the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> by thoſe nerves, a good reaſon of ſneezing may be given, and that Problem of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> eaſily ſolved, to wit, why men alone, or chiefly before other Creatures, ſneeze: For the act of ſneezing ſeems to be made for this end, that man may not only clear his Noſe, but that all Torpor or heavineſs may be ſhook off for him from the neighbouring Organs of the Senſes, yea and from all the fore-part of the Brain: which thing eaſily ſucceeds, if the Membranes and nervous paſſages beſmearing the Noſtrils and the Sieve-like Bone, like the holes of a Sponge, being ſtrongly wrung forth or ſqueezed together, be forced to ſhed forth their moiſtures; for theſe parts ſo emptied, preſently like a preſſed Sponge, receive other humors, to wit, thoſe coming from the neighbouring parts. In the mean time, that the watry heap ſo laid up about the caverns of the Noſtrils, may be emptied, it ought to be carried away, or wiped out from thence by a vehement blowing of the Air or breath. Wherefore it is obſerved, That whilſt the inward parts of the Noſtrils being very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, begin to be wrinkled together from ſome ſharp thing pulling or pricking them, and by that means to draw out the watry humor preſently by reaſon of the paſſage from thence by the branches of the fifth pair into the intercoſtal Trunk, and from thence by the paſſage of the nerves which are extended from its Cervical infolding into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> the conſent of the ſame Action or Convulſion is produced even into the croſs bound or Midriff; ſo that by the ſame Act as it were with which the Noſtrils are wrinkled, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> alſo with the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> being ſtronger and longer draw out, is depreſſed, that the Breaſt being dilated as much as may be, the Air may be the more copiouſly inſpired. Then as ſoon as the Spaſm or Convulſion of the Membranes, drawn together within the Noſtrils and fore-part of the Head, begins to remit, preſently the Midriff leaping back with a force, cauſes the inſpired Air to be violently exploded or driven out, which ſtrongly wipes away and carries forth with it the humor preſſed out within the caverns of the Noſtrils.</p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:107014:118"/>
                     <p>We yet ought to inquire concerning the Nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> what is the reaſon, that it always proceeds from the Brachial nerves, and why it doth not rather ariſe immediſitely from the ſpinal Marrow. Truly from hence it ſeems to follow, that the motion of the Arms in ſome ſort reſpects the action of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> or on the contrary, that this depends on that. Indeed between theſe two a certain reſpect or habitude happens; which eaſily appears by this Argument: The Arms or fore Legs in all Creatures are made for labour and hard exerciſe; becauſe by the force of theſe men fight, and perform the moſt hard and laborious things, and Brutes run and aſcend the moſt ſteep places with great pains. But it is very well known, that by too much labour and over vehement motion of body, the act of Reſpiration is very much increaſed, ſo that the breath almoſt fails, and is oftentimes in danger to be loſt. The reaſon of this is, becauſe by great exerciſe the blood is too much forced into the boſom of the Heart, which, leſt it ſhould ſuffocate it, that it might be emptied into the Lungs, very frequent and difficult Reſpiration is inſtituted. Therefore from hence may be inferred, That the exerciſes of the Body ought to be regulated according to the ſtate of the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> or that the motion of the Arms ſhould obſerve the action of the <hi>Diaphragma, viz.</hi> leſt they being ſtirred by a violent motion, cauſe the blood to be driven more into the boſoms of the Heart, than the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> inſtituting a moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reſpiration, can draw from thence into the Lungs. That this Rule may be perpetually obſerved of all living Creatures it is ſo provided, that the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> chiefly conducing to Reſpiration, ſhould be tyed, as it were a bridle, to the Brachial nerves, which are the principal in the motion of the Body, and ſo might timely warn theſe, if unmindful of their duty, and as ſoon as breath fails, ſhould command them to deſiſt from further moving the Body. Wherefore we obſerve, when at any time labouring Cattle are urged beyond their ſtrength in labour or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, oftentimes either ſome deadly hurt of the heart follows, or elſe ſome uncurable diſeaſe of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> for by ſuch immoderate labour, either the Beaſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing quickly dyes, when it is commonly ſaid, that his heart is broke; or elſe the tone of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being wholly broken, Reſpiration ever after becomes painful and difficult: which is wont to happen ordinarily to Horſes, who are driven into too rapid a courſe with a full Belly.</p>

Before we proceed to the other Conjugations of the Nerves, it behoves us to ſhew with what difference the aforeſaid Nerves are found in brute Beaſts, and for what end ſuch a difference is ordained.</p>
                     <p>It was already intimated, That the Trunk of the wandring pair in four footed Beaſts doth ſend forth to the Heart and its Appendix more nervous Veſſels than in Man. The reaſon of which is obvious; becauſe the Cardiack nerves in Brutes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed almoſt only from this pair, and ſcarce at all from the intercoſtal; wherefore when they are only of one origination, therefore more are required, all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notwithſtanding are much fewer than the ſame are in Man from a double ſtock, <hi>viz.</hi> being carried from both the Nerves: foraſmuch as Beaſts want prudence, and are not much obnoxious to various and divers Paſſions, therefore there was no need that the Spirits ſhould be derived from the Head into the <hi>Praecordia</hi> by a double paſſage,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107014:118"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that one ſhould be required for the exerciſe of the vital Function, and the other for the reciprocating impreſſions of the Affections; but that it may ſuffice, that all thoſe deſtinated to every one of their offices, may be carried ſtill in the ſame path.</p>
                     <p>In moſt Brutes the intercoſtal Nerve goes alone from the Ganglioform infolding of it almoſt without any branching to its infolding of the <hi>Thorax:</hi> in which paſſage how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is not always after the ſame manner in all; for in ſome it is carried ſingle and apart from the Trunk of the wandring pair, nor doth it communicate with it in its whole journey, unleſs a little higher by a ſhoot ſent down from the Ganglioform in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding: but in many the intercoſtal Nerve paſſes preſently from its Ganglioform infolding into the neighbouring infolding of the wandring pair, <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. <hi>C.</hi> where, when both the nerves ſeem to cloſe together, from thence both being involved under the ſame common incloſure, as it were one Trunk, they are carried together till it comes over againſt the firſt Rib, and there an infolding being made, the intercoſtal nerve, departing from the wandring pair, is carried into the infolding of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> and the other nerve alſo is ſtretched between this and that infolding: which nerves, when one is carried under the other above the Artery of the Chanel-bone, making as it were an handle, ſtraiten its Trunk, <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. <hi>g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although the intercoſtal Nerve is carried from the Throat to the top of the <hi>Thorax</hi> under the ſame ſheath with the Trunk of the wandring pair, yet it is not united to it; but they remain diſtinct ſtill both of them in the whole tract, and the Membrane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſected, they eaſily ſeparate one from the other, unleſs they be knit together by ſome fibrils ſent from one another in ſome places: but foraſmuch as by this means the intercoſtal nerve being joyned to the Trunk of the wandring pair, goes under its cover, it ſeems to be ſo made only for its ſafety and better paſſage: wherefore in ſome perhaps where the intercoſtal Trunk is greater, or the courſe of its paſſage ſhorter, where ſuch a ſafeguard is not needful, it deſcends alone. We have ſeen this Nerve covered with the ſafeguard of the wandring pair of one ſide, and in the other to have gone out by it ſelf alone.</p>
                     <p>Whether the intercoſtal Nerve departs from the lower Infolding of the wandring pair or not, however a branch is ſtretched out between this infolding and that of the <hi>Thorax</hi> in many, perhaps in all brute Beaſts, which in its paſſage binds about the Vertebral Artery, whereby the <hi>Sympraxis</hi> or joynt Action between the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the exterior Organs of Reſpiration is ſuſtained: yea from this lower infolding of the wandring pair ſometimes we have obſerved a ſhoot and fibres to be carried to the beginning of the Brachial branch, in which the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is rooted; alſo ſometimes, though rarely, we have ſeen ſome ſhoots ſent from the infolding of the <hi>Thorax</hi> towards the Heart and its Appendix. In a Monkey above this infolding of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as we have intimated before, were ſome ſhoots and ſmall branches reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the intercoſtal nerve towards the <hi>Praecordia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may take notice concerning thoſe Nerves below the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> diſtributed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where into the Ventricle and the lower <hi>Viſcera,</hi> that there is ſcarce any difference of them in Man and Beaſts. The nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is placed lower in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed beaſts: the reaſon of which is, becauſe the Brachial nerves, out of which that ought to proceed, ariſe lower; to wit, becauſe Brutes have longer necks, as if deſtinated to the yoke. Theſe things being thus premiſed concerning the difference of the Nerves in either Species, it remains that we paſs on to the unfolding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pairs of them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore of thoſe ariſing within the Skull, the ninth pair is made up of many Fibres alſo in its beginning, (as was ſhewed before) out of which being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one Trunk being made is carried towards the Tongue, through whoſe whole ſubſtance, to wit, from the bottom to the top, having paſſed, it diſperſes in its whole paſſage ſmall ſhoots on either ſide, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. So that nothing is more obvious than that this nerve performs the motions of the Tongue requiſite for the articulation of Sounds, as the nerves of the fifth pair ſpread into this member, ſerve for the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of Taſtes; for the exerciſe of either Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> both motive and ſenſitive, the texture of the Tongue being notedly fibrous, hath the virtue of a double Organ; therefore by the two nerves, beſides the ſupplements of Spirits, are carried both the Inſtincts of the Motion and the ſenſible Impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>That the aforeſaid Nerves of the ninth pair may more eaſily perform the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Tongue, it ſends forth downwards one ſhoot before the entrance of the Tongue, which is united with a ſhoot from the tenth pair meeting it deſtinated to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107014:119"/>the <hi>Sternothyroeidal</hi> Muſcle; and the other little branch of the ninth Conjugation is diſtributed into the Muſcles of the Bone <hi>Hyoides, Fig.</hi> 9. Θ. ☉. In truth theſe ſhoots being ſent down as ſo many little ropes, conduce to the moving of the Muſcles, which are fixed to the bottom of the Tongue, which Muſcles being placed as ſo many Props to the Tongue, do facilitate its motion.</p>
                     <p>The Nerve of the tenth pair, although it may ſeem to ariſe within the Skull with many little Fibres alſo, yet being ſent down from thence into the bony Cloiſters of the <hi>Spine,</hi> not ariſing but within the firſt and ſecond <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> it is carried without. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after its entrance it ſends forth two nerves into the infolding of the interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal nerve; for what end hath been already ſhewn: But its chief Trunk ſpreading downwards, and receiving a ſhoot produced from the ninth pair, is beſtowed on the <hi>Sternothyroeidal</hi> Muſcle. Moreover, this nerve reflects branches outwards, which are diſtributed into the Muſcles of the Neck reaching out towards the hinder part of the Head; ſo this pair, as if it were only of the number or rank of the Vertebral nerves, imparts ſome branches to the intercoſtal nerve, and all the other ſhoots and branches of it ſerve for the performing of the motions of the Muſcles of the Neck, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> *. ▭. Δ</p>
                     <p>So much for the Nerves ariſing within the Skull, which (as was ſhewn) having their being from the parts of the Brain or Cerebel, are deſtinated to the offices of the ſpontaneous or the involuntary Function, and are chiefly diſtributed into the Organs of the Senſes or the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the vital and natural Faculty. There remain many other Conjugations of Nerves, the roots or beginnings of which conſiſt in the ſpinal Marrow, which is only the exterior production of the oblong Marrow. Theſe ſpinal Nerves, beſides ſome branches that they beſtow on the intercoſtal pair, are imployed almoſt wholly on the muſculous ſtock, and the office of them is to carry outwardly the forces of the Spirits and the Inſtincts of the Motions to be performed, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey inwardly the impreſſions of ſenſible things. Foraſmuch as the ſpinal Marrow ſeems to be derived from the Brain, and is as it were a broad and high road produced or leading from the ſame, without any paths or tracts inſerted to it from the Cerebel, therefore the animal Spirits flowing within its nerves, do almoſt wholly execute the Acts of the ſpontaneous Function.</p>
                     <p>To deſcribe all the ſeveral pairs of the ſpinal Nerves, and to rehearſe all their branchings, and to unfold the uſes and actions of them, would be a work of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe labour and trouble: and as this <hi>Neurologie</hi> cannot be learned nor underſtood without an exact knowledge of the Muſcles, we may juſtly here forbear entring upon its particular inſtitution: but it may ſuffice concerning theſe nerves and their medullar beginning, that we advertiſe only in general what things may occur moſt notable and chiefly worth taking notice of.</p>
                     <p>As to the Nerves therefore produced out of the ſpinal Marrow, it may be obſerved, That in both ſides of it, nigh the outward margine or brim, four or five Fibres ariſe in the ſuperior brim, and as many in the inferior: either maniple or handful paſs through with diſtinct Fibres the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> or the loweſt Coat of the ſpinal Marrow, which is as it were the common ſheath of them all; but afterwards the Fibres paſſing through the third Membrane of either margine, (for three cloath the ſpinal Marrow) they joyn together, and having cloathed themſelves with a Coat gotten from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Membrane, they become as it were one Trunk; which Trunk going out at the ſpace between the knot of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> is again divided into many nerves deſtinated to ſeveral parts. After this manner in the whole tract of the ſpinal Marrow, the Vertebral nerves have their birth; but in thoſe places where the <hi>Brachial</hi> and the <hi>Crural</hi> nerves go out, both the thickneſs and the breadth of the ſpinal Marrow are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and alſo the handfuls or bands of the Fibres are larger. All theſe are well repreſented in <hi>Fig.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>The Brachial Nerves are not only far greater than the Vertebrals, ſo that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as it were large and broad nervous chords; but that they may conſpire together, and ſerve for the ſtrong motions of the Arms, or the fore Legs of Beaſts, it is obſerved. That very many of them are knit together by the croſs nervous Proceſſes. Theſe Proceſſes in four-footed Beaſts (the fore Legs of whom are deſtinated for unweariable pains and difficult lobour) are produced croſs ways after a curious manner, as may be diſcerned, <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. <hi>l. l.</hi> The uſe of theſe ſeems to ſuſtain not only the conſent of action in many nerves together, but alſo their mutual ſtrength; that ſome bands of Spirits might awaken or ſtir up others, and for the exerciſing ſtrongly the locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107014:119"/>force, they might mutually ſupport and relieve one another. And not much unlike this, the buſineſs is about the Crural Nerves, where nervous cords ſignally large, being produced from the Junctures of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> whilſt they deſcend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Thigh, they which are above receive in their whole tract the nervous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which are ſent out ſtill from thoſe below, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>p. p. p.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may yet take notice farther concerning the ſpinal Marrow, that as it ſends out Nerves by bands, and as it were by troops, in an orderly ſeries and military order; ſo its ſanguiferous Veſſels are diſpoſed with no leſs ſignal artifice. For thoſe which are carried in the ſuperficies of the ſpinal Marrow, and the Arteries, Veins, and other Sanguiducts, which are nigh its compaſs, do contain ſome things more rare and highly worth the noting.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place we may obſerve, That the blood-carrying Veſſels do cloath the whole ſubſtance or frame of the ſpinal Marrow, as well as the oblong Marrow with a thick ſeries of ſhoots; which may be made more manifeſt to any one, if firſt of all Ink were injected into the Vertebral Artery; for from ſuch an injection often repeated, it will eaſily appear, that the infoldings of the Veſſels do cover as it were in the ſhape of a Net, the upper tract of the Marrow. But by what means theſe Veſſels proceed on both ſides from the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery, and alſo the blood-carrying Veins, which are deſtinated to the whole ſpinal Marrow, and the inferior portion of its arterious paſſages, doth not ſo plainly appear; becauſe the bony Cloiſters of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are not broken through without much labour, eſpecially in grown up living Creatures; and in that work the beginnings and branchings out of very many Veſſels are wont to be blotted out: But that we might more accurately ſearch into theſe hid things, we made the Diſſections of ſeveral <hi>Embryons,</hi> in which we were able to diſſect the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> as yet ſoft, and to take out of them the Marrow whole, and to look more narrowly into all the receſſes of the Bones: further, that all the tracts and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings out of them might be the better perceived in all the Veſſels, we did caſt in divers coloured Liquors. And we had our deſired wiſh: for preſently we found with much admiration, that thoſe kind of Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> Arteries, Boſoms, and Veins, which reſpect the Head, belong alſo to the ſpinal Marrow with no leſs a noted diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of proviſion.</p>
                     <p>When we did diſſect the Heads apart from the Spine, we did think, according to the Opinion of the Vulgar, that the Vertebral Arteries did belong only to the Head: and when there did appear in the cut off Trunk of the oblong Marrow three arterious branches (as they are deſcribed above in the firſt and ſecond Table) therefore in the Explication of either Figure we have affirmed the Vertebral Artery to be carried with a triple branch into the hinder part of the Head. But the Vertebral Artery pays to the ſuperior part of the Spine as great Tributes of Blood as to the Head it ſelf; and that middle arterious branch, which is marked in the firſt Figure with the Letter T, in the ſecond with S, doth not aſcend into the Head, but deſcends from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Vertebral Arteries towards the Spine, and conveys downward from the common flowing together of the blood there made by many Arteries, the <hi>Latex</hi> for the watring the top of the ſpinal Marrow. Wherefore in this place it ſeems conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that we do not only correct that errour of ours, but that we deliver an exact Deſcription of all the Veſſels which are deſtinated to the Spine, <hi>viz.</hi> which contain many wonderful things. As therefore theſe Veſſels are of a threefold kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Boſoms, and Veins, we will expoſe each of them particularly; and firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Arteries we ſay,</p>
                     <p>The Arteries which carry the Blood towards the Spine, are diſpoſed after one manner above the Heart, and after another below it. As to the firſt, whereas the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> being there cleft preſently into many branches, departs from the Region of the Spine, therefore the Vertebral Artery is produced on both ſides from its axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary branches, which aſcending ſtraight into the hinder part of the Head, ſends forth a branch into the meeting together of every <hi>Vertebra:</hi> But below the Heart, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in its whole deſcent, lyeth on the Spine, two Arteries are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Spine from its bottom nigh its <hi>Internodia</hi> or ſpaces between the knots of the <hi>Vertebra;</hi> ſo that if the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> be cut open long-ways, there will appear a ſeries of double holes through its whole tract, after a moſt curious manner, as in the head of a Lamprey.</p>
                     <p>The arterious Branches which are carried both above and below the Heart towards the Spine, becoming preſently forked, beſtow one ſhoot on the neighbouring Muſcles,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107014:120"/>and another they inſert into the Junctures of the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> which being carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bony Den, is cleft preſently into three branches, two of which are beſtowed on the medullar Trunk, and the other on the Membrane compaſſing about the bony Den before, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. <hi>a. b. c. d. e.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the ſhoots deſtinated to the medullar Trunk, they preſently tending two ways, and meeting with either maniple or band of nervous Fibres, aſcend towards their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; and ſo one little Artery having got to the ſuperficies of the hinder Marrow, diſtributes into it hairy Veſſels: but the other arterious ſhoot, which is the greater and chiefeſt, as ſoon as it attains the margin of the former Marrow, is carried from thence by an oblique paſſage into the middle fiſſure or cleft of it, where meeting with a ſhoot of the pair of the other ſide, it is united to the ſame, and from that joyning together the arterious Trunk, as it were a common paſſage, and made up of either Vertebral ſhoot, deſcends into that cleft by the open ſpace of one of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and in that ſhort paſſage both diſpenſes little Arteries on either ſide, and alſo inſerts them leaning on the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> more deeply betwixt the ſides of the Marrow: and ſo whereas in the whole tract of the Marrow, the chief Trunk of every Artery is carried into the middle cleft, it ſeems at firſt ſight, as if the ſame arterious Trunk were carried under the whole ſubſtance of the Marrow from the head to the tail, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. Further, as by a concourſe of ſeveral ſhoots of either ſide, the ſpinal Artery deſcends above the cleſt of the Marrow; ſo where the Trunks of the Vertebral Arteries joyn together (which happens to be done ſometimes in the hinder part of the Head above the oblong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and often in the Neck above the ſpinal) an arterious branch ſomewhat bigger than the reſt is ſtretched out downwards. This formerly (as we mentioned but now) we miſtook for the third aſcending branch of the Vertebral Artery. But I have often taken notice, that in Brutes, where the Vertebral Arteries have met together with an acute Angle above the medullar Trunk, they are preſently, departing one from another, ſtretched out directly to either brim of the Marrow, from whence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately being bent back, they are carried again into a mutual meeting, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their two joynings together is made the figure <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> as it is in <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> The reaſon of which without doubt is this; to wit, that the more rapid courſe of the blood going towards the Head might be hindred by its flood being a little ſpace divided.</p>
                     <p>The third Branch of either Vertebral Artery being carried into the anterior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the bony Den, and being preſently made forked, tends to the right and left, and is on both ſides inoculated to the next ſhoot of the ſame ſide and by the croſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, they of either ſide are united after the ſame manner; and ſo all the Arteries of this cenſe or rank receive one another mutually, as it were links of a chain, in the whole tract of the Spine, and are continued in the ſame bending paſſage. If Ink be caſt into the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery and moſt of the hollowneſſes of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> all theſe Arteries, dyed with the ſame, will appear a pleaſant ſpectacle, like Net-work, as may be ſeen <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>The top of this arterious Infolding being carried into the Skull, inſerts two ſhoots ſent forth ſtraight into the wonderful Net, and imparts two others going out ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on both ſides to the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> the lower end of the ſame reaching to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> ends in very ſmall Veſſels which ſerve for the Membrane of the Bones.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be asked, For what end theſe Arteries being concatenated with ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ingraffings are diſpoſed within the Back-bone: This ſeems to be ſo ordained for three uſes: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, Theſe Veſſels (as alſo the paſſages of the Boſoms) are divari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated after this manner with repeated compaſſing about, that a conſtant heat from the blood being ſo turned about, as it were into frequent Whirlpools, might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied about the compaſs of the ſpinal Marrow, as it were by a <hi>Balneum Maria;</hi> even ſuch a manner of office as the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding performs within the infolding of the Brain. Secondly. Care is taken by this means, leſt the blood deſtinated for the ſpinal Marrow, might flow thither too plentifully, or might be defective in its due influx; for the blood being about to flow into the medullar ſtock plentifully, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the little branches <hi>c. d.</hi> into theſe Emiſſaries <hi>e. f.</hi> and in its defect the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiary proviſion being called out of the middle infolding through the chanel <hi>e.</hi> into the Veſſels <hi>c. d.</hi> is derived into the ſame medullar Trunk. Thirdly, The uſe of this arterious infolding ſeems to be, that the blood may be diſtributed from its paſſages into the Membranes, <hi>viz.</hi> which is carried every where from them through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary Veſſels; the reliques of which alſo are ſupped back by the little chanels ſent
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107014:120"/>out of the boſoms. Further, from this Store-houſe, if neceſſity urges, a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is had for the wants of the Brain; wherefore from hence the ſmall Veſſels end in the wonderful Net.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Arteries diſtributed about the <hi>Spine</hi> or Back-bone: the Veſſels of the ſecond ſort are the Boſoms which come between the Arteries and the Veins for the uſe of the ſpinal Marrow no leſs than of the Head it ſelf, and are here ordained with a more curious implication. But the reaſon why boſoms are required to theſe more noble parts, and ſcarce to any in the whole Body beſides, is this; to wit, that about theſe bodies all manner of extravaſation, or any ſtagnation of the blood, might be hindered: but ſometimes the Veins are not ſufficiently emptied, that they may preſently receive from the Arteries the depoſited blood, and ſo may prohibit any flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it; wherefore the boſoms, as more fit receivers, are deſtinated to that office, for that their receptacles are larger and ſoon emptied; and for that reaſon they may more conveniently derive the blood from either medullar ſubſtance, leſt it ſhould overflow it in the Head or Spine.</p>
                     <p>As to the Figure of the Vertebral Boſom, its paſſages being conform to the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious infolding, are put under it in the whole tract of the Spine: for after a like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in either boſom, which is extended within the cavity of the bony Den, from the hinder part of the Head to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> there is one receiving Veſſel, by whoſe twofold chanels preſently the blood is brought back from either ſuperficies of the Marrow into the boſom, and another carrying back, by whoſe paſſage the ſame is exported into the Veins. Moreover, in many Animals (though not in all) the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms on either ſide ſeem to be knit together upon the knots between the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> by the croſs proceſſes, and ſo communicate between themſelves: either boſom in its top is continued into the lateral boſoms of the Head; further, from it on both ſides a paſſage lyes open into the Jugular Vein and into the Vertebral, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>What the uſe of the aforeſaid Boſom is in general was but now intimated; to wit, that the blood depoſited from the Arteries in the ſpinal Marrow, might be preſently emptied from thence, and be retained within the more large Cavities of the Boſoms, till it may be transferred into the Veins being made more empty: But the reaſon of the divers ſorts of implications, and the frequent ingraffings which is found about their little chanels, ſeems to be, that the blood, if by chance it being plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heaped up within ſome part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oſom, ſhould there ſtagnate, or be apt to regurgitate into the Marrow, it might be drawn out by thoſe frequent Emiſſaries here or there into the middle or oppoſite ſide: after a like manner it is with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms about the Spine, as when a Country-man digs in his ground frequent croſs Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for the draining away any ſuperfluous moiſture.</p>
                     <p>There remains another uſe of the Vertebral Boſoms, of which we made mention before, to wit, that the blood nigh the medullar Body, being brought through their variouſly intorted Meanders, (like the arterious infoldings) might yield heat requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the ſwift paſſage of the animal Spirits, as it were a <hi>Balneum Mariae.</hi> That the bending tracts and complications of the Boſoms may be the better ſeen, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tincture may be caſt into the Vertebral Veins; and preſently that invading the paſſages of the boſoms and marking them, will exhibit the appearance of a long Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with many little labels hanging to it.</p>
                     <p>Yea at length by thoſe little roundles we are led to the third kind of Spinal Veſſels, which are the Veins, into which all the boſoms immediately convey their burden, whereby they being continually emptied, may be ſtill able to receive freſh blood: wherefore the venous branch is ſtretched out by the ſeveral joyntings of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> into the boſom, which preſently carries away the blood laid up in it, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced towards the Heart. The Veins deſigned to this office, after the example of the Arteries, are diſpoſed after one manner above the Heart, and after another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. As to the firſt, a branch going from the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> below the Chanel-bone, or the firſt little Rib of the Breaſt, accompanies the Vertebral Artery, and aſcending by the holes of the Proceſſes between the ſeveral <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> inſerts a little branch to the Boſom, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. <hi>h. h. h.</hi> Then the top of this Vein being carried towards the hinder part of the Head, is continued into the Trunk of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and opened by the other paſſage into the Jugular Vein. But further, as if theſe communications were not yet ſufficient for the draining away the blood, tranſverſe branches alſo are ſtretched out between both Veins, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. <hi>i. i. i.</hi> So mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diverting places appear, by which it is enough and more than enough provided,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107014:121"/>leſt the blood might flow back towards the medullar Trunk upon any occaſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Heart, becauſe the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> cannot, as the <hi>Aorta,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lean upon the Spine, and carry ſhoots ſtraight to the ſame, therefore it ſends forth a Vein without a Companion, out of whoſe Trunk forked or twofold branches being ſent forth, go forwards both to the Muſcles of both ſides and to the Spine it ſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Kidneys, ſeeing there is a ſpace granted for the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> to be carried nigh the Spine, the <hi>Azygos</hi> Vein ends, and from the Trunk of the greater Vein, as from that of the Artery, the Veſſels belonging to the Loyns immediately proceed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being lately obſerved concerning the blood carrying Veſſels belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spine and the hinder part of the Head, and here inſerted in the place of an Appendix, ought to be referred to the other Doctrine of this kind, delivered above in the eighth Chapter. In the mean time, that we may return to our purpoſe, to wit, what remains of <hi>Neurologie,</hi> there is not much more to be met with worthy note con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nerves: For they, as to the greater and chief Ramifications, are almoſt conſtantly both in Man and brute Beaſts, after the manner we have deſcribed them. Sometimes it happens, although very rarely, concerning the divarications of the ſmalleſt Shoots and Fibres, that there is ſome variety: but as to the primary Veſſels, and thoſe drawn from them, the Configuration of every pair of Nerves is ſtill the ſame or alike in all. It now remains, that the Theory of the Nerves, hitherto drawn in words, and ſo only objected to the Underſtanding, may alſo be ſhewn to the Senſe, which will make it clearer. Wherefore we have taken care, that the ingraven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations of the wandring and intercoſtal pair of Nerves, and alſo of others which are of chief note, and of the Spinal Marrow it ſelf be plainly exhibited. The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of theſe, although taken from a dead Example, yet after many Diſſections and a frequent comparing them together according to their ſeveral parts, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as if from the life; the Lineaments of which with <hi>Characteriſtical</hi> Notes, that they may be the better and more diſtinctly perceived, and a large draught of every Figure, equal almoſt to the Scheme of Nerves in their animated Body, we have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be cut: further, becauſe the Contents of either ſide and of the Cavity between, cannot be at once deſcribed in their proper ſituation; therefore here it is ſuppoſed, That the <hi>Spine,</hi> with the oblong Marrow, or the whole medullar Stock, cut in the midſt is rolled out, and both ſides of it, with the pairs of the Nerves ariſing in the whole Tract, is turned outward.</p>

                     <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                     <p>THUS much for the Anatomy of the Brain and Cerebel, and of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, both Medullar and Nervous, and of the Uſes and Offices of all the ſeveral Parts, of which we have largely treated. There yet remains, after we have viewed, not only the outward Courts and Porches of this Fabrick, as it were of a certain Kingly Palace, but alſo its intimate Receſſes and private Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that we next inquire into, what the Lady or Inhabitant of this Princely place may be, in what part ſhe doth chiefly reſide, and by what Rule and Government ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and orders her Family. Then we ought to take notice, what defects and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities happen to it, or to its parts and powers; then to what injuries of changes or diſeaſes this Building or Houſe, to wit, the Brain and nervous Stock, may be obnoxious. For indeed I am as it were bound, by reaſon of the Work it ſelf, and the promiſe I made before, that for the Crown of the Work, a certain Theory of the Soul of Brutes ſhould be added after the naked Anatomical Obſervations and Hiſtories of Living Creatures, and of their animated Parts. Truly it is but juſt and equal, that we enter upon this Diſcourſe of the Soul, and that other task of <hi>Pathologie,</hi> to wit, that the Aſperities and hard ſence of our already inſtituted <hi>Anatomy</hi> may be ſweetned with thoſe kind of more pleaſant Speculations, as it were cloathing the Skeleton with fleſh; and that the Reader being wearied by a long and troubleſom Journey, may be a little refreſhed and recreated. For in truth, whatſoever of our Work is performed without form or beauty, may ſeem as the Foundation of a Building only placed on the ground, in which no elegancy or neatneſs doth yet ſhine, but that all things appear rude, and as yet built of rough and unpoliſhed ſtones. A Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture indeed may be promiſed to be put upon this Foundation, perhaps fair and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, whereby the minds of the Beholders may be pleaſed and inſtructed. But truly this kind of work may be too hard and great to be performed by our weakneſs: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it become me to proceed in my undertakings, before theſe have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the Cenſure and chance to which they are ſubject. For I fear, leſt this Foundation, but now laid, ſhould become too weak and feeble for the ſuſtaining an higher Fabrick, at leaſt until this hath for ſome time undergone the tryal, by lying open to winds and ſtorms.</p>
